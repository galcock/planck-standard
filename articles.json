      "headline": "Ripple CEO Predicts 90% Chance CLARITY Act Passes by April",
      "subheadline": "Proposed legislation would draw definitive lines between SEC and CFTC jurisdiction over digital assets",
      "body": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed strong confidence that the CLARITY Act, a bill aimed at resolving one of crypto's longest-standing regulatory questions, has a 90% chance of becoming law by April.\n\nThe legislation would establish clear boundaries between which digital assets fall under securities law, regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and which are classified as commodities subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight. The distinction has been a source of persistent legal battles and industry uncertainty for years, most notably in the SEC's prolonged case against Ripple itself.\n\nGarlinghouse's optimism reflects a broader shift in Washington's posture toward crypto regulation. Rather than relying on enforcement actions to define the rules, lawmakers appear increasingly willing to codify a framework through legislation. If passed, the CLARITY Act would represent the most significant piece of U.S. digital asset regulation to date, potentially reshaping how tokens are issued, traded, and governed. Industry observers caution, however, that legislative timelines remain inherently unpredictable, and the bill still faces potential hurdles in both chambers of Congress.",

      "headline": "Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Surges 15%, Largest Jump in Four Years",
      "subheadline": "Network difficulty hits 144.4T as global hashrate recovers to 1 ZH/s, even as miners face historically low revenue per hash",
      "body": "Bitcoin's mining difficulty has spiked 15% in its latest adjustment, reaching 144.4 trillion — the largest single increase since 2021. The jump signals a dramatic recovery in global hashrate, which has climbed back to approximately 1 zettahash per second, reflecting renewed computational power being directed at the network.\n\nThe surge is notable given the challenging economics facing miners. Hashprice — the revenue miners earn per unit of computational power — has fallen to multi-year lows amid a broader slump in Bitcoin's market price. The divergence between rising difficulty and shrinking profitability suggests that large-scale mining operations are continuing to expand capacity even as margins compress, likely betting on a future price recovery or leveraging more efficient next-generation hardware.\n\nDifficulty adjustments are an automatic feature of the Bitcoin protocol, recalibrating roughly every two weeks to maintain a consistent block production rate of approximately one every ten minutes. A 15% increase of this magnitude indicates that substantial new mining infrastructure has come online in a short period. For smaller or less efficient mining operations, the combination of higher difficulty and depressed prices could accelerate consolidation in an industry already trending toward institutional-scale players.",

      "subheadline": "The venture firm dramatically escalates its India bet, up from an earlier $500M–$1B earmark over five years",
      "body": "General Catalyst has committed $5 billion to investments in India over the next five years, a dramatic escalation that signals deepening confidence in the country's startup ecosystem from one of Silicon Valley's most prominent venture firms.\n\nThe pledge represents at least a fivefold increase from the firm's previous India earmark of $500 million to $1 billion, underscoring a broader trend of major global investors channeling significantly larger sums into the Indian market. India has emerged as one of the world's fastest-growing startup hubs, buoyed by a massive domestic consumer base, expanding digital infrastructure, and a maturing pool of technical talent.\n\nThe commitment positions General Catalyst as one of the largest single-firm backers of the Indian venture landscape, putting it in the company of sovereign wealth funds and Tiger Global-scale deployments. The move comes as India's technology sector continues to produce high-profile public listings and late-stage companies across fintech, enterprise software, and consumer internet. For General Catalyst, the bet reflects a strategic conviction that India will be a defining market for global technology growth in the second half of the decade.",

      "subheadline": "Born from the frustrations of building a vertical farm, the platform offers typed schemas, WASM-based actions, and a novel DuckDB data layer",
      "body": "Fostrom, a new IoT cloud platform built by former vertical farming startup founders, has launched in technical preview with the goal of eliminating the infrastructure burden that plagues connected device development.\n\nCo-founders Arjun and Sid built the platform after spending more time wrestling with IoT plumbing than writing automation logic at their previous company. Fostrom offers device SDKs in Python, JavaScript, and Elixir, along with typed schemas, per-device mailboxes, programmable actions executed via WebAssembly, and deployment across four global regions. The underlying architecture reflects years of iteration: a Go-to-Elixir bridge runs JavaScript in WASM for device actions, a Rust-based device agent handles background operations, and a custom DuckDB library powers the data layer.\n\nPerhaps the most consequential design choice was the team's decision to abandon distributed databases in favor of a DuckDB-based replicated multi-tenant SQL layer for fleet data. After years of experimenting with distributed architectures, the founders concluded that the consistency and querying limitations were fundamentally at odds with the operational correctness and reliability that IoT systems demand. The SQL-first approach, they say, dramatically simplified the codebase while concentrating operational complexity into a manageable number of components. The platform's device agent, DeviceKit, is open source on GitHub. Fostrom plans to release a CLI tool and automatic device monitoring as it moves beyond technical preview.",

      "body": "Neo, the accelerator founded by tech investor Ali Partovi, is rethinking how startup programs work with a new Residency program that offers significantly more favorable terms than traditional accelerators.\n\nThe program will invest $750,000 in selected startups through an uncapped SAFE — a structure that avoids setting a valuation cap and typically results in far less dilution for founders than the fixed-equity deals offered by established accelerators like Y Combinator. Alongside the startup track, Neo is offering college students a $40,000 grant with no strings attached, positioning itself as an early talent pipeline that doesn't demand equity from young founders who may not yet have a company to give equity in.\n\nThe move represents a direct challenge to the prevailing accelerator model, where programs like YC take a standard 7% equity stake in exchange for $500,000. By using an uncapped SAFE with a larger check size, Neo is betting that attracting top-tier founders requires ceding less ownership upfront — a wager that the quality of its network and programming can generate returns even without locking in favorable valuations early. For a startup ecosystem increasingly debating whether accelerator economics still serve founders well, Neo's experiment could pressure competitors to revisit their own terms.",

      "body": "Bitcoin fell near the $68,000 level as escalating tensions between the United States and Iran rippled through global markets, dampening appetite for risk assets and sending investors toward traditional safe havens. Gold prices jumped sharply on the flight to safety.\n\nThe downturn in crypto markets mirrored a cautious tone across U.S. equities, where investors are weighing the potential for a broader geopolitical confrontation alongside existing macroeconomic uncertainties. Some strategists are warning that the current selloff may not yet be over, pointing to a potential retest of 2024 lows before any sustained recovery can take hold.\n\nThe divergence between gold and bitcoin during the risk-off episode underscores an ongoing debate about the leading cryptocurrency's role as a safe-haven asset. While bitcoin proponents have long argued it serves as digital gold, episodes of geopolitical stress have repeatedly shown the token trading more in line with risk assets than traditional stores of value. For now, markets remain on edge as traders monitor diplomatic developments and assess whether the current tensions will escalate or de-escalate in the days ahead.",
