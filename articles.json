      "headline": "Dopamine Drugs Linked to Gambling, Sex Addictions in Hundreds of UK Patients",
      "subheadline": "Despite known risks, GP prescriptions for dopamine agonists remain unchanged as lawmakers demand regulatory review",
      "body": "More than 250 people have contacted the BBC to report developing severe addictions — including compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, and uncontrollable spending — after being prescribed dopamine agonist drugs for movement disorders such as Restless Legs Syndrome and Parkinson's disease. The accounts span a wide cross-section of British society, from police officers and nurses to bank executives, and describe devastating financial losses, broken marriages, criminal behavior, and suicides.\n\nThe drugs, which include Ropinirole manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, work by boosting dopamine activity in the brain. While dopamine is essential for regulating movement, it also governs motivation and reward pathways — and overstimulation can trigger impulsive behaviors with no prior history. Roughly one in six Parkinson's patients taking these medications experiences some form of impulse control disorder, a prevalence rate that would classify the side effect as \"very common\" under standard pharmaceutical labeling. Yet patient leaflets do not state this frequency, and critics say the warnings that do exist — describing \"increased libido\" or \"harmful behaviour\" — are too vague to alert patients or their doctors to specific risks like pornography addiction, compulsive sex work use, or pathological gambling.\n\nThe investigation has also uncovered that GSK learned of a case of paedophilia linked to Ropinirole as early as 2000, when a 63-year-old man on the drug sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl. An internal 2003 GSK report described a link between the drug and \"deviant\" sexual behavior, yet no warnings about sexual urges appeared on labels until 2007. GSK told the BBC it shared its findings with the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency promptly, while the MHRA said the delay reflected the time required to evaluate all available evidence. GSK maintains that the drug was extensively trialled and that side effects are clearly stated.\n\nDespite dopamine agonists being recently downgraded from first-line treatment status for Restless Legs Syndrome, prescription levels among GPs in England have not declined. Last week, the chair of the House of Commons Health Select Committee formally asked the MHRA to review its warnings, and the UK government called the BBC's findings \"hugely concerning.\" Many affected patients say they have no clear path to legal redress in the UK, though cases are advancing abroad. A Belgian court last year acquitted a man of sexual assault on the grounds that Ropinirole caused his behavior, and a major French ruling is expected next month in a lawsuit against GSK by a patient who lost €90,000 to compulsive gambling and spending and is seeking damages and an acknowledgment of corporate liability.\n\nThe stories paint a consistent picture: patients with no prior history of addictive or deviant behavior who were blindsided by side effects that neither they nor their physicians recognized as drug-related. One woman described losing at least £30,000 to gambling after being prescribed Ropinirole, only discovering the connection through news reports rather than medical advice. \"It's ruined my life,\" she said. Charities including Parkinson's UK and RLS-UK are urging affected patients to seek support, while the NHS advises anyone on these medications with concerns to speak to their doctor immediately.",

      "subheadline": "Latest technical problem adds to a growing list of delays for the agency's Artemis program and its crewed lunar ambitions",
      "body": "NASA's Space Launch System rocket encountered a new technical issue over the weekend, casting doubt on the agency's plan to send astronauts toward the Moon as early as March. The setback, reported Saturday, represents the latest in a series of complications that have dogged the heavy-lift vehicle and the broader Artemis program.\n\nWhile NASA has not yet disclosed full details of the problem, the timing is critical. A March crewed launch would mark a historic milestone — the first time astronauts have traveled beyond low Earth orbit since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. Any significant delay to the timeline would ripple through an already compressed Artemis schedule and could affect downstream missions, including plans for a crewed lunar landing.\n\nThe SLS rocket and its Orion crew capsule have faced a troubled development history marked by cost overruns and repeated postponements. The uncrewed Artemis I mission, which successfully sent Orion on a loop around the Moon, provided confidence in the vehicle's core design, but subsequent preparations for crewed flights have exposed additional engineering challenges. Each new issue forces teams at Kennedy Space Center to weigh the risk of pressing forward against the imperative of crew safety — a calculus that almost always favors caution.\n\nThe potential slip comes at a politically sensitive moment for NASA. The agency is under pressure from Congress and the White House to demonstrate tangible progress toward returning humans to the lunar surface, even as commercial alternatives from SpaceX and other providers offer competing architectures at potentially lower cost. Further delays to SLS could intensify calls to reconsider the program's role in America's deep-space exploration strategy.\n\nNASA engineers are expected to provide an updated assessment in the coming days. If the issue proves manageable, a launch attempt could still occur in late March or early April. But if more extensive repairs or testing are required, the mission could slip by weeks or longer, pushing the agency's carefully sequenced Artemis timeline further into uncertainty.",

      "subheadline": "Norwegian physicists report evidence of a material that carries both electricity and spin with zero resistance",
      "body": "A team of physicists at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology believes it has observed the first compelling evidence of a triplet superconductor — a long-theorized class of material that could transport both electrical current and electron spin without any energy loss, potentially transforming quantum computing and spintronic technology.\n\nThe material in question is NbRe, an alloy of the rare metals niobium and rhenium. In a study published in Physical Review Letters and selected as an editor's recommendation, Professor Jacob Linder and collaborators at NTNU's QuSpin research center, working with experimental partners in Italy, demonstrated that NbRe exhibits behavior fundamentally inconsistent with conventional singlet superconductors. Unlike standard superconductors, which carry electricity with zero resistance but cannot transmit spin, a triplet superconductor would do both — enabling the lossless transfer of spin-based information, a capability that physicists have long considered a holy grail of quantum materials research.\n\nThe practical implications are significant. One of the foremost challenges in quantum computing is maintaining the stability and accuracy of quantum operations. Triplet superconductors could address this directly by enabling spin currents that flow without resistance, potentially allowing quantum computers to operate with dramatically reduced energy consumption. \"Extremely fast computers could operate using almost no electricity at all,\" Linder said, describing the theoretical promise of the material class.\n\nNbRe also carries a practical advantage over other triplet superconductor candidates: it becomes superconducting at approximately 7 Kelvin, which, while still near absolute zero, is considerably more accessible than the sub-1 Kelvin temperatures required by competing materials. That difference matters enormously for experimental reproducibility and eventual engineering applications.\n\nLinder cautioned that the findings remain preliminary. Independent experimental groups will need to replicate the results, and additional tests specific to triplet superconductivity must be performed before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Nevertheless, the NTNU team's data represent the strongest evidence to date that an intrinsic triplet superconductor exists in a bulk material. If confirmed, NbRe could become a foundational component in next-generation quantum processors and spintronic devices, marking a milestone in condensed matter physics that researchers have pursued for decades.",

      "subheadline": "The company's internal monitoring tools detected alarming content months before an 18-year-old allegedly killed eight people in Canada",
      "body": "OpenAI's internal safety systems flagged violent content in conversations by the suspect in a deadly Canadian mass shooting months before the attack, but the company ultimately decided against notifying law enforcement, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\nJesse Van Rootselaar, an 18-year-old who allegedly killed eight people in a mass shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, had used ChatGPT to describe gun violence in ways that triggered the company's misuse-detection tools. OpenAI banned her account in June 2025, and staff internally debated whether to contact Canadian police — but concluded her activity did not meet the company's threshold for law enforcement referral. OpenAI only reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police after the shooting occurred. \"Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said, adding that the company provided information to investigators and would continue supporting their probe.\n\nThe case raises urgent questions about what obligations AI companies have when their platforms surface potential threats. Unlike social media companies, which have developed protocols over years for reporting violent content to authorities, large language model providers are still navigating uncharted territory around user safety and intervention. OpenAI has not publicly disclosed the specific criteria it uses to determine when flagged content warrants a report to police, leaving a significant gray area in an industry where chatbot interactions can be deeply personal and potentially revealing of intent.\n\nVan Rootselaar's troubling behavior extended well beyond ChatGPT. She reportedly created a mass-shooting simulation game on Roblox, a platform popular with children, and posted about firearms on Reddit. Local police had also previously been called to her family's home after she started a fire while under the influence of drugs — a pattern of warning signs spread across multiple platforms and institutions, none of which individually triggered a decisive intervention.\n\nThe incident adds to mounting scrutiny of AI chatbot safety. Multiple lawsuits have been filed against OpenAI and competitors alleging that LLM-powered chatbots have encouraged users to self-harm or commit suicide. As ChatGPT's user base skews young — OpenAI recently disclosed that 18- to 24-year-olds account for nearly half of its usage in India — pressure is building on the company to establish clearer, more proactive safety protocols that extend beyond simply banning accounts after harmful content is detected.",

      "subheadline": "Supreme Court tariff ruling provides short-term relief, but looming review of trilateral trade pact poses deeper uncertainty",
      "body": "Mexico and Canada have secured an exemption from a new 10 percent U.S. levy following the Supreme Court's decision to strike down a broad swath of tariffs imposed under the Trump administration, but trade analysts warn the reprieve may be short-lived as far larger risks loom over the trilateral trade relationship.\n\nThe court's ruling offered immediate relief to America's two largest trading partners, effectively shielding goods flowing across both borders from the additional duties that will now apply to imports from other nations. Yet the exemption does little to address the deeper structural uncertainty surrounding the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the successor to NAFTA that governs roughly $1.6 trillion in annual trade among the three economies. With a scheduled review of the pact approaching, all three governments face the prospect of renegotiation — or, in a worst-case scenario, potential withdrawal — that could fundamentally reshape North American supply chains.\n\nFor Mexico, which sends approximately 80 percent of its exports to the United States, the stakes are particularly acute. Canadian officials have likewise signaled concern that any reopening of USMCA terms could invite new demands on sectors ranging from agriculture and dairy to automotive manufacturing and digital trade. The automotive industry, which has built deeply integrated cross-border production networks over decades, stands as one of the most exposed sectors should trade barriers rise.\n\nThe Supreme Court's willingness to limit executive tariff authority marks a significant constitutional development, constraining the White House's ability to unilaterally impose duties without clear congressional authorization. But trade experts note that the ruling does not preclude the administration from pursuing other protectionist measures, including through the USMCA review process itself. The agreement contains a sunset clause requiring the three nations to confirm their continued participation, a mechanism that gives any party significant leverage to demand concessions.\n\nBusiness groups on both sides of the border have urged all three governments to approach the upcoming review as an opportunity to modernize and strengthen the agreement rather than relitigate its core provisions. For now, the exemption from the new levy provides breathing room — but the larger question of whether North America's integrated trade architecture will endure in its current form remains very much unresolved.",

      "subheadline": "President defies Supreme Court ruling invalidating earlier trade actions, raising tariff rate from 10% to 15%",
      "body": "Bitcoin slid nearly 1% on Saturday after President Donald Trump announced he was raising his worldwide tariff on imported goods to 15%, escalating trade tensions even as the U.S. Supreme Court had just struck down his earlier tariff actions as unconstitutional.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was trading around $68,500 following the announcement, after briefly ticking up 0.5% before reversing course. Ether also declined, falling 0.45% to approximately $1,980. The move underscored how sensitive digital asset markets remain to macroeconomic policy shocks, particularly those that threaten to disrupt global trade flows and risk appetite.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social that he was immediately implementing the higher rate, calling the Supreme Court's recent decision — which found he lacked authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — \"anti-American.\" The 15% levy represents an escalation from the 10% global tariff the president had announced just days earlier in response to the court's ruling. Trump indicated his administration would determine \"new and legally permissible tariffs\" over the coming months, suggesting the current action may itself face legal challenges.\n\nThe constitutional confrontation between the executive branch and the judiciary adds a layer of uncertainty that markets have struggled to price. The Supreme Court's IEEPA ruling had initially been seen as a potential stabilizer for risk assets, including crypto, by constraining the president's ability to unilaterally impose trade barriers. Trump's defiant response has complicated that calculus, leaving investors to weigh whether the escalating tariffs will survive legal scrutiny or be struck down again.\n\nThe broader crypto market reflected a cautious tone heading into the weekend. Bitcoin has been under pressure after peaking in October, with Google searches for \"bitcoin to zero\" hitting record highs in the United States during February — a signal that some analysts interpret as elevated retail anxiety, though historically such spikes have occasionally coincided with market bottoms. With trade policy uncertainty now layered on top of existing bearish sentiment, traders appear to be positioning defensively until greater clarity emerges on the legal and economic ramifications of Washington's tariff standoff.",

      "subheadline": "Iranian state-affiliated media claims Washington conceded on Tehran's key red line in ongoing nuclear talks",
      "body": "American negotiators have agreed to allow Iran to maintain its uranium enrichment program, according to a report from Iran's semi-official Students' News Agency (ISNA), citing an unnamed Iranian diplomat. If confirmed, the concession would mark a significant shift in Washington's negotiating posture and a major win for Tehran, which has long insisted that its enrichment capabilities are non-negotiable.\n\nThe claim, reported on February 21 by Bloomberg, has not been independently verified by U.S. officials. Washington has historically sought strict limits on Iran's enrichment activities, viewing them as a potential pathway to a nuclear weapon. Under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed to cap enrichment at 3.67 percent and reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium — but those constraints collapsed after the United States withdrew from the deal in 2018 under the Trump administration. Iran subsequently ramped up enrichment to 60 percent purity, close to the roughly 90 percent threshold needed for weapons-grade material.\n\nThe reported development comes amid what appears to be a renewed diplomatic push between Washington and Tehran, though the precise format and scope of the current talks remain opaque. Accepting continued enrichment — even with potential limits on purity levels or stockpile size — would represent a departure from the maximalist demands that characterized previous U.S. negotiating rounds, which at times called for Iran to entirely dismantle its enrichment infrastructure.\n\nAnalysts caution that statements from Iranian state-affiliated media during active negotiations often serve a dual purpose: signaling to domestic audiences that Tehran is negotiating from a position of strength while simultaneously testing international reaction. Without confirmation from U.S. or European officials, the claim should be treated with considerable caution. Still, the report is likely to draw scrutiny from lawmakers in Washington and from regional allies, particularly Israel and Gulf Arab states, who have expressed deep concern about any agreement that leaves Iran's enrichment capabilities intact.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly flagged gaps in its ability to monitor Iran's nuclear activities, making the terms of any enrichment arrangement — including verification mechanisms — a critical factor in whether a potential deal could win broader international support.",

      "subheadline": "Business and Trade Committee meets Tuesday as government also considers legislation to remove Andrew from royal succession",
      "body": "British lawmakers on the House of Commons Business and Trade Committee are set to meet Tuesday to consider launching a formal inquiry into the role and oversight of UK trade envoys, following the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on suspicion of misconduct in public office.\n\nThe cross-party committee will examine the appointment process and accountability structures governing the country's 32 trade envoys, who operate across six continents as intermediaries between the UK government and foreign business and political leaders. Andrew served as Britain's trade envoy from 2001 to 2011, a position that afforded him extensive access to sensitive government and commercial information worldwide. Committee chair Liam Byrne said MPs are taking the allegations \"acutely seriously,\" though the inquiry would initially focus on systemic governance issues rather than Andrew specifically, given the active police investigation.\n\nThe move follows Andrew's arrest by Thames Valley Police on Thursday — his birthday — on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He was detained for 11 hours before being released under investigation. Emails released as part of millions of files connected to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein suggest Andrew may have forwarded government reports from visits to Vietnam, Singapore, and China to Epstein in 2010, as well as information on gold and uranium investment opportunities in Afghanistan. Police continued searching Royal Lodge, Andrew's former 30-room Windsor residence, over the weekend, with operations expected to run through Monday. Metropolitan Police have also contacted Andrew's protection officers to determine what they may have witnessed.\n\nThe crisis has accelerated broader constitutional action. Defence Minister Luke Pollard confirmed the government is working with Buckingham Palace on legislation to remove Andrew — currently eighth in line to the throne — from the royal line of succession. Such a move would require an act of Parliament, royal assent from King Charles, and approval from 14 Commonwealth realms where the monarch serves as head of state. The last comparable action came in 1936, when Edward VIII and his descendants were removed following his abdication. The Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party have signaled support, though some Labour MPs have questioned whether the legislation is necessary given how remote Andrew's chances of ascending to the throne already are.\n\nAndrew, who was stripped of his prince title in October 2025 after King Charles initiated a formal process, has previously denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and has not responded to BBC requests for comment on the specific allegations. Historian David Olusoga observed a \"desperate desire within government and within the palace to draw a firewall between this crisis and the wider monarchy.\"",

      "body": "Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called on the United Kingdom and its European allies to send non-combat military personnel to Ukraine immediately, rather than waiting for a negotiated end to the war — a proposal that would represent a dramatic escalation of Western involvement in the conflict.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg alongside Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the former head of the British armed forces, Johnson argued that deploying troops to peaceful areas of Ukraine in non-fighting roles could \"flip a switch\" in Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategic calculus. \"If we can have a plan for boots on the ground after the war, after Putin has condescended to have a ceasefire, then why not do it now?\" Johnson said. He framed the move as a political statement of support for Ukrainian sovereignty rather than a military escalation, insisting that such forces \"wouldn't be there in a war-fighting capacity.\"\n\nThe comments, made just days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, go significantly further than the current British government position. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has been leading a \"coalition of the willing\" involving more than 30 nations to prepare a reassurance force for Ukraine — but only in the event of a peace deal. The Ministry of Defence responded to Johnson's remarks by highlighting existing support, including a recent £500 million air defense package and £200 million to prepare British military units for a potential future deployment. Moscow has already signaled its view of any such move: in September, Putin declared that any troops deployed to Ukraine would be considered \"legitimate targets.\"\n\nJohnson also offered a striking retrospective admission that the war could have been prevented, pointing to a cascade of Western failures — the muted response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, inaction after the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons in Syria, and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 — as having emboldened Putin. \"The general ambiguity of the Western position\" harmed Ukraine, he said, acknowledging personal regret for not having done more during his tenures as foreign secretary and prime minister. Radakin echoed the theme of insufficient urgency, describing the allies' pattern of delayed weapons deliveries as \"incrementalism\" that Ukraine found \"deeply frustrating.\"\n\nWhile Johnson's proposal is unlikely to gain immediate traction with the current government, it reflects a growing debate in European capitals about the adequacy of Western commitments as the war grinds on. Radakin used the interview to press the government on its pledge, made at last year's NATO summit, to raise defense spending to 3.5 percent of national income by 2035. \"We have made that commitment. NATO is challenging us. Where is our plan?\" he said. Analysts noted that while sending troops now remains politically fraught, intermediate steps — such as establishing a safe zone in western Ukraine or reopening Lviv's airport — could emerge as compromise measures in allied discussions ahead of any ceasefire agreement.",

      "subheadline": "Meltwater production has increased more than sixfold since 1990, with extreme episodes growing in frequency and scale",
      "body": "Extreme melting episodes across the Greenland ice sheet have grown dramatically more frequent, expansive, and intense over the past three decades, according to new research published in Nature Communications. The study, led by scientists at the University of Barcelona, quantifies the accelerating transformation of the world's second-largest ice sheet under climate change — with implications for global sea-level rise.\n\nSince 1990, the area affected by extreme melting events has expanded at a rate of 2.8 million square kilometers per decade, the researchers found. Perhaps more strikingly, the volume of meltwater generated during these episodes has surged more than sixfold, climbing from 12.7 gigatons per decade to 82.4 gigatons per decade. A single gigaton of water is roughly equivalent to 400,000 Olympic swimming pools, underscoring the sheer scale of ice loss now underway at high latitudes.\n\nThe findings paint a picture not merely of gradual warming but of a system experiencing compounding stress. Extreme melt events — periods when surface melting far exceeds historical norms — are no longer rare anomalies. They are becoming a defining feature of Greenland's climate regime. The research team analyzed satellite-era data and climate reanalysis products to track how the character of these episodes has shifted across multiple dimensions simultaneously: their spatial footprint, their duration, and the total mass of ice they convert to liquid water.\n\nThe Greenland ice sheet holds enough frozen water to raise global sea levels by approximately 7.4 meters if it were to melt entirely, a scenario that would unfold over centuries but one whose early stages are already measurable. Ice loss from Greenland has been one of the leading contributors to observed sea-level rise in recent decades, and the new study suggests the trajectory is steepening. As extreme melt events become more severe, they can trigger cascading effects — darkening the ice surface through exposure of underlying dust and algae, which in turn absorbs more solar radiation and accelerates further melting in a self-reinforcing loop.\n\nThe research adds to a growing body of evidence that polar ice sheets are responding to warming more aggressively than many models have projected. With global temperatures continuing to climb, the frequency and magnitude of these extreme episodes are expected to increase further, amplifying Greenland's contribution to rising seas in the decades ahead.",

      "subheadline": "With $4 billion in withheld tax revenue, schools open just three days a week, and new Israeli annexation measures accelerating",
      "body": "The Palestinian Authority is facing an existential crisis as Israel implements sweeping new administrative measures in the occupied West Bank that a senior United Nations official has described as \"gradual, de facto annexation,\" even as the governing body's finances buckle under the weight of billions in withheld tax revenue.\n\nThe PA says Israel now owes it more than $4 billion in tax transfers that it collects on the authority's behalf — funds withheld over a dispute concerning Palestinian school curricula and stipends paid to families of Palestinians jailed or killed by Israel. The fiscal stranglehold has forced the PA to pay most public sector workers, including doctors, teachers, and police, just 60 percent of their salaries. Schools serving more than 600,000 children now operate only three days per week, with further closures in villages near settlements when Israeli soldiers or settlers are present. Some children have reached fourth grade unable to read, according to residents of al-Mughayyir, a village northeast of Ramallah that has become a frontline of settler expansion.\n\nThe financial squeeze has deepened since October 7, 2023, when roughly 100,000 Palestinians lost permits to work inside Israel, devastating household incomes across the West Bank. Meanwhile, Israeli settlements — deemed illegal under international law — are expanding at a record pace. New land registration procedures could allow Israel to claim large portions of the territory as state land for future development, and Israeli enforcement of environmental and archaeological regulations is being extended into areas nominally under PA civil control. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a settler who oversees settlement policy, pledged at a conference near Ramallah this week to \"officially and practically cancel the damn Oslo agreements\" if he remains in government after elections expected this year, explicitly stating his goal is to destroy the prospect of Palestinian statehood.\n\nMore than 80 UN member states, the European Union, and the Arab League have condemned the Israeli measures and called for their reversal, though the United States has limited its response to reiterating opposition to formal annexation. Former PA minister Sabri Saidam warned that Palestinian existence on its ancestral territory is being \"compromised,\" calling the moment a turning point. International studies professor Ghassan Khatib urged the global community to treat the situation as a \"wake-up call,\" arguing that decades of political and financial investment in a two-state solution are being systematically dismantled.\n\nThe PA's predicament is compounded by its exclusion from immediate post-war governance in Gaza, where it lost control in 2007 after Hamas won parliamentary elections. President Trump's peace framework envisions the PA eventually overseeing Gaza after completing an unspecified reform program, but offers only vague language about a future \"credible pathway\" to statehood. Israeli officials have dismissed warnings of PA collapse while characterizing the authority as \"corrupt and morally bankrupt.\" On the ground in villages like al-Mughayyir — where a 14-year-old Palestinian boy was shot dead by an Israeli soldier last month — residents say the risk of widespread unrest is growing, and that the PA's deepening impotence may push Palestinians toward less moderate alternatives.",

      "subheadline": "President invokes rarely used trade law to impose maximum duties, which take effect Tuesday and face a five-month deadline for congressional approval.",
      "body": "President Donald Trump escalated his trade offensive on Saturday, announcing that global tariffs on all goods entering the United States would be set at 15% — just one day after proposing a 10% baseline rate following a landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down his earlier import taxes.\n\nThe rapid escalation came in a post on Truth Social, where Trump said his administration had reviewed what he called the \"ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs\" handed down by the court on Friday. The 6-3 Supreme Court ruling found that Trump had exceeded his presidential authority when he imposed sweeping global tariffs last year under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law that the justices determined did not grant the executive branch unilateral power to levy broad import duties.\n\nRather than accept the judicial check, Trump moved swiftly to a different legal mechanism — a never-before-used trade statute that permits the president to impose tariffs of up to 15% without prior congressional approval, but only for a limited window of roughly five months. The new duties are set to take effect on Tuesday, February 24, meaning importers and trading partners have minimal time to adjust. After the statutory period expires, the administration would need to secure approval from Congress to maintain the levies.\n\nThe move injects fresh uncertainty into global commerce at a moment when supply chains and financial markets were already grappling with the fallout from months of elevated trade tensions. A 15% across-the-board tariff would raise costs on a vast range of imported consumer goods, industrial inputs, and commodities, potentially fueling inflationary pressures that the Federal Reserve has been working to contain. Major U.S. trading partners — including the European Union, China, Japan, and Mexico — are likely to weigh retaliatory measures, risking a broader escalation.\n\nThe constitutional clash between the White House and the Supreme Court adds a significant legal dimension to the dispute. Friday's ruling represented one of the most consequential judicial constraints on executive trade power in decades, and Trump's immediate pivot to an alternative statute signals that the administration intends to test the boundaries of presidential authority on tariffs until Congress or the courts intervene again. Whether lawmakers will ultimately back the president's approach — or use the five-month clock as leverage to negotiate a different trade framework — remains an open question with enormous economic stakes.",

      "subheadline": "Automated system executed nearly 9,000 trades on short-term crypto contracts, raising questions about the future of crowd-sourced probability markets",
      "body": "An automated trading bot has reportedly generated nearly $150,000 by exploiting fleeting pricing inefficiencies in short-term cryptocurrency prediction markets — executing 8,894 trades without human intervention and highlighting the growing role of AI-driven strategies in reshaping these nascent venues.\n\nThe strategy, which circulated widely on social media this week, targeted a deceptively simple flaw in five-minute bitcoin and ether prediction contracts on platforms like Polymarket. In a properly functioning market, the price of a \"Yes\" contract and a \"No\" contract on a binary outcome should always sum to exactly $1.00. But thin liquidity, rapid price swings in the underlying asset, and order-book imbalances can briefly push that combined price below $1.00 — sometimes to $0.97 or less. By purchasing both sides simultaneously during these dislocations, the bot locked in a guaranteed profit of roughly 1.5% to 3% per trade when the contract settled. At an estimated $1,000 deployed per round-trip, that translated to approximately $16.80 in profit per execution — trivial in isolation, but compounding to a six-figure return across thousands of repetitions.\n\nThe opportunity persists in part because prediction markets remain too shallow for institutional players to exploit at scale. Typical five-minute bitcoin contracts on Polymarket carry order-book depth of just $5,000 to $15,000 per side during active sessions — orders of magnitude thinner than perpetual swap books on exchanges like Binance or Bybit. A firm attempting to deploy $100,000 per trade would obliterate the available liquidity and erase any edge. Blockchain-based settlement mechanics, transaction costs, and operational complexity further deter large desks, leaving the field to nimble retail traders comfortable sizing positions in the low four figures.\n\nMore sophisticated variants of the strategy are already emerging. Some AI-driven systems now compare implied probability distributions from options markets — which encode collective expectations about where an asset will trade — against prediction market pricing on the same outcome. When discrepancies appear, even of just a few percentage points, automated systems can buy the underpriced side. Machine learning tools have lowered the barrier to building such strategies, enabling traders to test variations, optimize execution thresholds, and adapt to shifting volatility regimes without hand-coding every parameter.\n\nThe trend raises a structural question for prediction markets, which were designed to aggregate human beliefs into crowd-sourced probabilities about real-world events. As a growing share of volume shifts toward cross-market arbitrage bots that hold no view on actual outcomes, these platforms risk becoming mirrors of the broader derivatives market rather than independent probability signals. Arbitrageurs may improve pricing efficiency in the short term by closing gaps across venues, but the phenomenon echoes a familiar pattern in crypto markets: inefficiencies are discovered, exploited, and competed away with remarkable speed. The $150,000 windfall may already represent a closing window.",

      "subheadline": "In a 6-3 ruling, justices held Trump exceeded his authority — but the president moved within hours to reimpose duties under a different law",
      "body": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Friday that President Donald Trump overstepped his constitutional authority by imposing sweeping global tariffs under a 1977 emergency powers law, delivering a landmark rebuke of his trade agenda — only for Trump to immediately sign a proclamation establishing a new 10% tariff under a separate, never-before-used statute.\n\nThe 6-3 decision, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) did not grant the president the power to levy tariffs. \"Had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs, it would have done so expressly,\" Roberts wrote. Two Trump-appointed justices — Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch — joined the majority alongside the court's three liberal members, while Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Samuel Alito dissented. Trump responded with fury, calling the Republican appointees who ruled against him \"fools and lap dogs\" and declaring himself \"absolutely ashamed\" of their votes.\n\nThe ruling potentially opens the door to billions of dollars in refunds. The government has collected at least $130 billion in IEEPA-based tariffs, according to federal data, and hundreds of companies — from Costco to Bumble Bee — have already filed lawsuits seeking reimbursement. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker sent Trump an invoice for nearly $9 billion, estimating the tariffs cost each family in his state $1,700. However, experts cautioned that refunds could take years, with the logistics likely falling to the Court of International Trade. \"Curb your enthusiasm,\" warned Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, noting that litigation costs could prove prohibitive for smaller businesses.\n\nTrump's countermove came swiftly. Within hours of the ruling, he signed a proclamation invoking Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which permits tariffs of up to 15% for 150 days before requiring congressional approval. The new 10% levy takes effect February 24 and includes exemptions for certain minerals, agricultural products, pharmaceuticals, and some electronics. Canada and Mexico will retain their exemptions under the USMCA free trade agreement. Notably, countries that had previously negotiated trade deals with the U.S. — including the United Kingdom, India, and the European Union — will now face the blanket 10% rate instead of their individually negotiated terms, though the administration expects them to honor existing concessions.\n\nWall Street responded positively to the Supreme Court decision, with the S&P 500 closing up roughly 0.7%. But analysts warned the trade landscape has grown more uncertain, not less. The administration is expected to explore additional legal tools, including Section 232 and Section 301, which authorize tariffs on national security and unfair trade grounds. Existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles imposed under those authorities were unaffected by Friday's ruling. \"Things have only gotten more complicated and more messy today,\" said Geoffrey Gertz, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. International reaction was measured, with the European Commission saying it was \"analysing carefully\" and French President Emmanuel Macron praising the American system of checks and balances while signaling France would assess the implications of the new levy.",

      "body": "A team of scientists has unveiled a novel microscopy technique that combines the strengths of two established imaging methods, enabling researchers to visualize the internal structure of cells and pinpoint the locations of individual proteins — all in vivid color and at nanometer-scale resolution.\n\nThe approach introduces a new contrast mechanism for biological imaging that bridges a longstanding gap in microscopy. Traditional methods have generally forced researchers to choose between techniques that reveal fine structural detail and those that identify specific molecular components. The new hybrid method eliminates that trade-off, delivering both architectural and molecular information in a single imaging session. The result is an unprecedented view of cellular interiors, with proteins mapped against the backdrop of organelles and membranes at resolutions previously achievable only by sacrificing one form of information for the other.\n\nAt the heart of the technique is a contrast mechanism that allows nanometer-resolution imaging without the conventional compromises between structural and functional data. While electron microscopy has long offered extraordinary spatial resolution, it typically renders cells in grayscale and struggles to distinguish specific biomolecules. Fluorescence microscopy, by contrast, excels at tagging and locating proteins but lacks the resolution to capture surrounding ultrastructure in fine detail. By merging elements of both paradigms, the new method produces richly colored, high-resolution maps of cellular landscapes.\n\nThe implications extend across cell biology, neuroscience, and biomedical research. Researchers studying how proteins organize within cellular compartments — or how that organization goes awry in disease — stand to benefit from a tool that simultaneously answers \"what is here?\" and \"what does it look like?\" at the nanoscale. The ability to co-register structural and molecular data in a single experiment could accelerate discoveries in areas ranging from cancer biology to neurodegeneration, where the spatial relationships between proteins and cellular structures are thought to play critical roles.\n\nThe technique represents a meaningful advance in the broader push toward multimodal imaging, a field that has gained momentum as researchers seek ever more complete pictures of biological systems. Further development could expand the palette of detectable molecules and push resolution limits even further, potentially opening new windows into the molecular machinery of life.",

      "body": "A New York congressional race has become the unlikely battleground for a proxy war between two factions of the artificial intelligence industry, with super PACs funded by Anthropic and OpenAI backers spending millions to shape the political future of AI regulation in the United States.\n\nPublic First Action, a political action committee that received a $20 million donation from Anthropic, announced it is spending $450,000 to support Alex Bores, a New York Assembly member running for the state's 12th congressional district, according to Bloomberg. Bores has been under sustained attack from Leading the Future, a rival super PAC armed with more than $100 million from donors including venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI President Greg Brockman, AI search company Perplexity, and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale. That group has already spent $1.1 million on ads targeting Bores.\n\nThe conflict centers on Bores' sponsorship of New York's RAISE Act, legislation that would require major AI developers to disclose their safety protocols and report serious incidents of misuse. Leading the Future, which opposes such regulatory measures, launched its campaign against Bores late last year as he announced his congressional bid. Public First Action, while also pro-AI, advocates for a regulatory framework built around transparency, safety standards, and public oversight — a philosophy more closely aligned with Anthropic's public positioning as a safety-focused AI lab.\n\nThe race offers a striking illustration of how the AI industry's internal divisions over regulation are spilling into electoral politics. Anthropic, which has generally positioned itself as more receptive to government oversight than some competitors, is now directly funding political infrastructure to counter lobbying from firms that favor a lighter regulatory touch. The spending gap remains significant — Leading the Future's war chest dwarfs Public First Action's current outlay — but the escalation signals that AI policy disputes are no longer confined to congressional hearings and think tank white papers.\n\nFor voters in New York's 12th district, the contest presents an unusual dynamic: both sides of the campaign are bankrolled by companies building the very technology at issue. The outcome could send an early signal about whether candidates who support AI safety legislation can survive well-funded industry opposition — or whether the sector's deepest pockets will set the terms of the debate heading into the 2026 midterms.",

      "subheadline": "Emory University researchers analyzed 27.8 million older Americans and found fine particulate matter harms the brain directly",
      "body": "Long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution is associated with a significantly higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease — and the danger appears to stem from pollution's direct effects on the brain rather than through intermediate chronic conditions, according to one of the largest studies ever conducted on the subject.\n\nResearchers led by Yanling Deng at Emory University examined Medicare records from more than 27.8 million Americans aged 65 and older, spanning nearly two decades from 2000 to 2018. Published February 17 in the open-access journal PLOS Medicine, the study tracked new Alzheimer's diagnoses against estimated air pollution exposure levels while controlling for co-occurring health conditions such as hypertension, stroke, and depression. The central finding: polluted air raises Alzheimer's risk largely by acting on the brain itself, not by first triggering cardiovascular or psychiatric illness that then leads to cognitive decline.\n\nThe distinction matters because scientists have long debated the mechanism linking air pollution to dementia. Fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, is already established as a risk factor for stroke, high blood pressure, and depression — all of which are themselves associated with heightened dementia risk. The Emory team's analysis found that neither hypertension nor depression meaningfully amplified the pollution-Alzheimer's connection, suggesting those conditions are not the primary pathway. One notable exception emerged: individuals with a prior history of stroke did show heightened vulnerability to pollution's cognitive effects, pointing to an important intersection between environmental and vascular risk factors.\n\nWith roughly 57 million people living with Alzheimer's worldwide, the implications extend well beyond academic debate. The findings bolster the case that improving air quality could serve as a population-level strategy for reducing dementia rates, particularly among aging communities in polluted urban areas. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and adds to a growing body of evidence — including a 2025 review covering nearly 30 million people — that positions air pollution as a modifiable environmental driver of neurodegeneration.\n\nFor policymakers weighing the costs and benefits of emissions regulation, the research offers a stark new data point: the price of dirty air may include not just respiratory and cardiovascular disease, but the erosion of cognitive health across tens of millions of older adults.",

      "body": "A federal court has sentenced 29-year-old Ukrainian national Oleksandr Didenko to five years in prison for orchestrating an identity theft operation that enabled North Korean workers to fraudulently obtain jobs at dozens of American companies — funneling wages back to Pyongyang's sanctioned nuclear weapons program.\n\nDidenko, a Kyiv resident, operated a website called Upworksell that served as a marketplace where overseas workers, including North Koreans, could purchase or rent stolen identities belonging to U.S. citizens. According to the Department of Justice, Didenko handled more than 870 stolen identities through the platform before the FBI seized it in 2024 and redirected its traffic to government servers. Polish authorities arrested Didenko, who was subsequently extradited to the United States, where he pleaded guilty to the charges.\n\nBeyond the identity marketplace, prosecutors said Didenko maintained so-called \"laptop farms\" — rooms filled with open laptops hosted at the homes of paid accomplices in California, Tennessee, and Virginia. The setup allowed North Korean operatives to remotely access the machines and perform their work as though they were physically present in the United States, evading geographic detection by employers.\n\nThe conviction is the latest in a growing series of prosecutions targeting what cybersecurity researchers have called North Korea's \"IT worker\" schemes. CrowdStrike reported a sharp increase last year in North Korean operatives infiltrating Western companies, typically in remote software development and engineering roles. Security experts have characterized these workers as a \"triple threat\": they violate U.S. sanctions, steal sensitive corporate data, and later extort victim companies by threatening to release proprietary information.\n\nThe schemes represent one of several revenue streams the North Korean regime relies on to circumvent international sanctions that have largely cut it off from the global financial system. Pyongyang-linked actors have also been known to impersonate recruiters and venture capitalists in social engineering campaigns targeting high-net-worth individuals, particularly in the cryptocurrency sector. The Justice Department's statement this week underscored the U.S. government's commitment to disrupting what officials describe as an escalating national security threat operating at the intersection of cybercrime and state-sponsored sanctions evasion.",

      "subheadline": "Private-equity firm's forced asset sale rattles markets; analysts debate whether private credit stress could trigger Fed intervention bullish for bitcoin",
      "body": "Blue Owl Capital was forced to liquidate $1.4 billion in assets this week to meet redemption demands from investors in a retail-focused private credit fund, sending its shares tumbling roughly 14% and dragging down major private-equity peers including Blackstone, Apollo Global, and Ares Management. The selloff has prompted prominent figures in finance to openly question whether the episode marks the opening act of a broader credit unraveling.\n\nFormer Pimco CEO Mohamed El-Erian described the situation as a potential \"canary-in-the-coalmine\" moment, drawing a direct parallel to August 2007, when two Bear Stearns hedge funds collapsed under the weight of subprime mortgage losses — an event widely regarded as the first tremor before the global financial crisis. El-Erian cautioned that while the risks could prove systemic, they do not yet appear to approach the magnitude of 2008. Still, he flagged artificial intelligence market excesses as a potential amplifier worth watching. Former Peter Lynch associate George Noble went further, suggesting Blue Owl could represent a \"first domino\" in a chain that substitutes private credit for subprime mortgages as the catalyst.\n\nBlue Owl shares have now fallen more than 50% year-over-year, though the broader stock market averages have so far absorbed the shock without significant damage. The private credit market, which has ballooned in recent years as banks retreated from certain lending activities, faces a structural vulnerability: many of its funds promised periodic liquidity to retail investors while holding inherently illiquid loan portfolios. When redemption requests spike, managers may be forced into fire sales — precisely the dynamic that played out this week.\n\nFor bitcoin, currently trading near $68,500, the implications cut in two directions. In the near term, tightening credit conditions tend to punish risk assets broadly. Bitcoin's 70% plunge during the early weeks of the Covid crisis in March 2020 offers a cautionary precedent. But the policy response that followed — trillions of dollars in Federal Reserve liquidity injections and near-zero interest rates — propelled bitcoin from below $4,000 to above $65,000 within roughly a year. The 2008 crisis itself birthed the cryptocurrency entirely; Satoshi Nakamoto embedded a headline about bank bailouts into Bitcoin's genesis block on January 3, 2009.\n\nWhether Blue Owl's troubles remain an isolated liquidity event or metastasize into something larger will likely depend on how concentrated the stress is within private credit and whether other funds face similar redemption pressures. If the 2007-2008 playbook repeats — initial credit stress, market denial, contagion, then massive central bank intervention — bitcoin's role as a perceived hedge against monetary debasement could once again come into sharp focus, even as the asset has evolved far beyond its anti-establishment origins into a trillion-dollar fixture of the institutional financial landscape.",

      "body": "Oil markets are experiencing their most robust start to a year since 2022, driven by a combination of supply shocks and sanctions that have shattered earlier forecasts of a global glut — and traders are now racing to hedge against the possibility of renewed U.S. military action against Iran.\n\nThe scramble for downside and upside protection reflects growing anxiety across energy markets that geopolitical risk premiums, which many analysts had expected to fade in early 2026, are instead intensifying. The prospect of U.S. strikes on Iranian targets has emerged as a central concern, prompting a surge in options activity as market participants seek to insulate portfolios from a potential spike in crude prices. The hedging rush underscores how quickly sentiment has shifted from fears of oversupply to fears of supply disruption.\n\nAt the start of the year, the prevailing consensus among oil analysts pointed toward a well-supplied market weighed down by tepid demand growth and expanding production from non-OPEC sources. That thesis has been upended by a series of unexpected supply interruptions and the tightening effect of sanctions enforcement, which have constrained the flow of barrels onto the global market. The result has been a sustained rally that caught many traders off guard and forced a rapid repricing of risk.\n\nIran remains the focal point of the market's anxiety. Any escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions — particularly involving direct military strikes — could threaten the passage of crude through the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world's most critical oil chokepoints through which roughly a fifth of global petroleum consumption flows daily. Even a temporary disruption to transit through the strait could send prices sharply higher and ripple through global energy supply chains.\n\nThe combination of a tightening physical market and elevated geopolitical uncertainty has created a volatile trading environment that shows few signs of calming. For energy desks and commodity funds, the message is clear: the risks that defined oil trading in 2022 — war, sanctions, and supply fragility — have returned with force, demanding active risk management rather than passive positioning.",

      "subheadline": "Crypto's fleeting rally contrasts with sustained equity gains as stagflationary economic data clouds the outlook",
      "body": "Bitcoin jumped roughly 2% to above $68,000 on Friday after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's tariff regime in a landmark 6-3 ruling, but the cryptocurrency surrendered its gains within minutes, settling back near the $67,000 level in a pattern that has become frustratingly familiar to digital asset traders.\n\nThe high court's decision declared that Trump had exceeded his constitutional authority in imposing sweeping import tariffs, noting in its opinion that no president has ever \"invoked the statute to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope.\" The ruling cited a \"lack of historical precedent\" combined with the \"breadth of authority\" claimed by the executive branch as evidence that the tariffs extended beyond legitimate presidential power. While the decision was widely anticipated to be market-positive — removing a source of significant economic uncertainty — crypto markets proved unable to hold onto the initial enthusiasm.\n\nThe rapid fade in bitcoin stood in sharp contrast to equities, where the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6% to a session high and appeared to sustain its advance. The divergence underscores a persistent dynamic in cryptocurrency markets: modest rallies are being met with immediate selling pressure. On-chain data from analytics firm Santiment has shown that larger bitcoin holders — wallets containing between 10 and 10,000 BTC — have been reducing their positions since bitcoin's all-time high in October, while smaller retail wallets have been accumulating. Analysts say this imbalance helps explain why recoveries have been shallow and short-lived.\n\nCompounding the uncertain mood, a batch of U.S. economic data released earlier Friday painted a stagflationary picture. The Commerce Department reported that GDP grew just 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025, while core personal consumption expenditure prices rose 3% year-over-year, exceeding the consensus estimate of 2.9%. For the full year, the economy expanded only 2.2% — its weakest pace since the pandemic year of 2020. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, called the data a \"messy message\" that confirms the Federal Reserve's inclination to move cautiously on monetary policy.\n\nBitcoin has logged its worst first 50-day performance to start a year on record, and the combination of persistent inflation, slowing growth, and whale-driven selling pressure suggests the path forward remains choppy. Whether the removal of tariff uncertainty eventually provides a more durable tailwind for risk assets — including crypto — may depend on how quickly the economic data begins to improve.",

      "subheadline": "A quiet FAQ update applies just a 2% haircut to stablecoin holdings, putting them on par with money market funds",
      "body": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has made a potentially transformative change to how broker-dealers account for stablecoin holdings, allowing firms from Robinhood to Goldman Sachs to treat dollar-pegged tokens as regulatory capital with only a 2% haircut — a dramatic departure from previous guidance that effectively zeroed them out.\n\nThe change, published this week as a new entry on the SEC's \"Broker Dealer Financial Responsibilities\" FAQ page, means that firms can now count 98% of their stablecoin holdings — including major tokens like Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT — toward their capital requirements. Previously, the prevailing interpretation imposed what amounted to a 100% haircut, treating stablecoins as unmeasurable against a broker-dealer's capital tally and effectively penalizing firms for holding them. The update places stablecoins on essentially the same regulatory footing as money market funds on a firm's balance sheet.\n\nThe practical implications are substantial. Broker-dealers, which are registered with the SEC to handle customer securities transactions and trade on their own behalf, will now find it far easier to custody tokenized securities, provide liquidity, facilitate settlement, and participate in the growing tokenized finance ecosystem. \"Stablecoins are now working capital,\" wrote Larry Florio, deputy general counsel at Ethena Labs, in an analysis posted on LinkedIn. Tonya Evans, a crypto education executive and board member at Digital Currency Group, noted that the financial penalty for holding stablecoins \"is over.\"\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who leads the agency's Crypto Task Force, issued a statement saying the change \"will make it feasible for broker-dealers to engage in a broader range of business activities relating to tokenized securities and other crypto assets.\" Peirce also signaled appetite for going further, saying she wants to explore how existing SEC rules \"could be amended to account for payment stablecoins.\" Cody Carbone, CEO of the Digital Chamber, called the guidance a step toward reducing uncertainty for compliant firms.\n\nHowever, the informal nature of the change underscores its fragility. Staff guidance can be reversed as easily as it is issued, lacking the legal protections of formal rulemaking. The SEC has been working on crypto-specific rules in recent months, but the rulemaking process typically takes months or years. This reality continues to drive industry calls for congressional legislation — such as the GENIUS Act passed last year — to enshrine digital asset policy in law rather than leave it subject to shifting agency leadership.",

      "body": "Artificial intelligence is producing fake news that people consistently perceive as more credible than disinformation written by humans, according to findings from a multilingual linguistics research project that underscores growing concerns about AI's role in the information ecosystem.\n\nSilje Susanne Alvestad, a linguist leading the \"Fakespeak—the language of fake news\" project, has been investigating the specific linguistic features that distinguish fabricated news content from legitimate reporting. Working with research colleagues across three languages — English, Russian, and Norwegian — Alvestad's team has found that AI-generated false content tends to lack the telltale stylistic markers that might otherwise alert readers to deception. The finding suggests that as large language models grow more sophisticated, the traditional linguistic red flags associated with disinformation are being smoothed away.\n\nThe research builds on nearly a decade of heightened attention to fake news as a societal threat. Norway's Language Council selected \"fake news\" as its word of the year back in 2017, reflecting the term's rapid entry into public consciousness. But while awareness of the problem has grown, Alvestad's work indicates the challenge has evolved significantly. Where human-authored fake news often betrays itself through exaggerated language, emotional manipulation, or structural irregularities, AI-produced content can mimic the measured, authoritative tone of professional journalism with unsettling fidelity.\n\nThe multilingual dimension of the Fakespeak project is particularly notable. By examining disinformation across English, Russian, and Norwegian, the researchers are mapping whether the linguistic signatures of fake news vary by language and cultural context, or whether universal patterns exist that could form the basis of detection tools. The cross-linguistic approach may prove critical as AI-generated disinformation increasingly targets audiences across borders and language barriers simultaneously.\n\nThe findings arrive at a moment when policymakers, technology companies, and media organizations are struggling to keep pace with the volume and quality of machine-generated content flooding online platforms. If AI text lacks the linguistic fingerprints that have historically helped both human readers and automated systems flag suspicious content, new detection frameworks — potentially drawing on insights from projects like Fakespeak — will be essential to maintaining the integrity of public discourse.",

      "body": "A significant avian influenza outbreak in New Jersey has left at least 1,100 birds dead or sickened, predominantly Canada geese, since the first cases were reported on February 14, according to state officials. The scale of the die-off has prompted authorities to close affected lakes and issue public health advisories.\n\nThe outbreak, which began on Valentine's Day and has rapidly escalated, represents one of the larger regional bird flu events in recent memory. State wildlife and public health agencies have moved to restrict access to water bodies where infected birds have been found, aiming to limit potential exposure to both humans and other animal populations. Canada geese, which congregate in large flocks near lakes and ponds throughout the state, appear to be the primary species affected.\n\nBird flu, caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, has been a persistent concern across the United States in recent years, devastating poultry operations and wild bird populations alike. While human infections remain rare, health authorities have urged New Jersey residents to avoid contact with sick or dead birds and to keep pets away from affected areas. The virus can spread through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated surfaces, and authorities have emphasized that proper reporting of dead wildlife is essential to tracking the outbreak's trajectory.\n\nThe closure of recreational lakes adds an economic and social dimension to the crisis, particularly as communities prepare for the transition into spring. Local officials are coordinating with state wildlife agencies and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to monitor the situation, conduct testing, and manage carcass removal. The speed at which the outbreak has grown — more than a thousand birds in a matter of weeks — underscores the challenge of containing highly pathogenic strains once they take hold in wild bird populations.\n\nPublic health experts note that while the immediate risk to humans remains low, continued surveillance is critical. The ongoing national HPAI outbreak, which has affected dozens of states and led to the culling of millions of domestic poultry since 2022, shows no signs of abating. New Jersey's mass geese die-off serves as a stark reminder that wild birds remain a key vector for the virus's spread.",

      "subheadline": "Growing internal frustration over president's handling of potential exit raises questions about institutional authority",
      "body": "Reports that European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde may step down before her term expires have triggered a wave of confusion and frustration inside the Frankfurt-based institution, with staff questioning her authority and the bank's near-term policy direction.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, ECB personnel have been left unsettled by the swirling speculation about Lagarde's early exit, with internal sentiment described as a mix of confusion, irritation, and uncertainty. The reports have raised pointed questions about how effectively Lagarde can steer the eurozone's monetary policy while her own future at the helm remains unresolved — a particularly sensitive concern as the ECB navigates a complex economic landscape marked by sluggish growth, persistent geopolitical risks, and ongoing debates over the pace of interest rate adjustments.\n\nLagarde, who took office in November 2019 as the ECB's first female president, holds an eight-year non-renewable term that would ordinarily run through October 2027. Any premature departure would set off a high-stakes political negotiation among EU member states to select a successor, a process that has historically involved intense horse-trading between Europe's largest economies. The timing of such a leadership vacuum could prove particularly disruptive given the ECB's delicate balancing act between supporting a fragile eurozone recovery and maintaining credibility on inflation.\n\nThe internal discontent appears to center not merely on the possibility of Lagarde leaving, but on how the situation has been managed — or left unmanaged — within the institution. Central banks depend heavily on clarity and predictability, both in external communications with markets and in internal governance. An extended period of ambiguity over the presidency risks undermining staff morale and complicating the Governing Council's ability to project a unified front on policy decisions.\n\nNeither Lagarde nor the ECB has publicly confirmed any plans for an early departure. But the episode underscores the broader challenge facing European institutions, where top appointments are as much products of political consensus as they are of technocratic credentials. Whoever ultimately leads the ECB through the remainder of this decade will face the task of restoring internal cohesion while steering monetary policy through an era of unusual economic uncertainty.",

      "body": "A bacterium responsible for everyday pneumonia and sinus infections may be quietly accelerating Alzheimer's disease, according to a new study from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center published in Nature Communications on February 21.\n\nResearchers discovered that Chlamydia pneumoniae — a widespread respiratory pathogen — can persist for years in both the eye and the brain, where it triggers inflammation, kills nerve cells, and stimulates the production of amyloid-beta, the protein whose accumulation is the hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology. The findings, drawn from analysis of retinal tissue from 104 human participants as well as cell culture and animal experiments, represent the first demonstration that the bacterium can travel to the retina, potentially making the eye an early warning system for the neurodegenerative disease.\n\nParticipants with Alzheimer's diagnoses showed significantly higher levels of Chlamydia pneumoniae in both their retinas and brains compared to cognitively normal individuals. Greater bacterial loads correlated with more severe brain damage and steeper cognitive decline. The association was particularly pronounced among carriers of the APOE4 gene variant, the most significant known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's. In laboratory experiments using human nerve cells and Alzheimer's mouse models, infection with the bacterium directly increased inflammation, neuronal death, and amyloid-beta production — strengthening the case for a causal link rather than mere correlation.\n\n\"Seeing Chlamydia pneumoniae consistently across human tissues, cell cultures and animal models allowed us to identify a previously unrecognized link between bacterial infection, inflammation and neurodegeneration,\" said Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, professor of Neurosurgery, Neurology, and Biomedical Sciences at Cedars-Sinai and the study's senior author. She noted that retinal imaging could serve as a noninvasive screening tool to identify individuals at elevated Alzheimer's risk. Co-corresponding author Timothy Crother said the results raise the possibility of \"targeting the infection-inflammation axis\" as a novel therapeutic strategy, potentially through early antibiotic intervention or anti-inflammatory treatments.\n\nThe study adds momentum to a growing body of research implicating chronic infections in neurodegenerative disease, a hypothesis that has gained traction in recent years alongside the dominant amyloid-centric model of Alzheimer's. If validated in larger clinical trials, the findings could reshape both early detection and treatment paradigms for a disease that affects an estimated 6.9 million Americans. The research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the Alzheimer's Association, and several private foundations.",

      "body": "President Donald Trump said Friday he is weighing a limited military strike on Iran, escalating pressure on Tehran as nuclear negotiations enter what both sides describe as a critical phase. The remarks came hours after senior administration officials had publicly raised the possibility of military action.\n\nTrump told reporters earlier in the week that the world would learn \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether Iran would agree to a deal constraining its nuclear program or face U.S. military force. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi responded Friday by announcing that Tehran is preparing \"a draft of a possible agreement\" to be delivered to U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff within days. The two sides have been holding talks in Geneva, with both characterizing the discussions as productive.\n\nThe diplomatic maneuvering is unfolding against a backdrop of significant American military buildup in the region. The USS Gerald R. Ford — the world's largest warship — appears to be heading toward the vicinity of Iran, joining the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group alongside an expanding flotilla of destroyers, combat ships, and fighter jets. Satellite imagery indicates Iran has bolstered its own military installations in response, while Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has posted veiled threats aimed at U.S. forces on social media.\n\nThe situation carries echoes of last July's Operation Midnight Hammer, when U.S. forces struck Iranian nuclear facilities even as White House officials were still publicly discussing the prospects for successful negotiations. The day before that strike, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt read a Trump statement suggesting he would decide on military action \"within the next two weeks\" — language strikingly similar to his current rhetoric. Trump has long favored strategic ambiguity, frequently reminding journalists he prefers to keep adversaries guessing about his intentions.\n\nAny military escalation would arrive at a politically delicate moment for the administration. Trump is contending with the Supreme Court's landmark ruling striking down his sweeping tariff regime, and polls show growing public dissatisfaction with his handling of immigration and the economy. A protracted, multi-week campaign against Iran — reportedly among the range of options presented to the president by military planners — could risk alienating elements of his MAGA base, many of whom were drawn to his promises to avoid costly foreign entanglements. The United States and its European allies maintain that Iran is moving toward developing a nuclear weapon, an accusation Tehran has consistently denied.",

      "body": "A sweeping genomic analysis of ancient microbes has yielded compelling evidence that the ancestors of all complex life — plants, animals, and fungi — were already capable of using oxygen long before they evolved into the first eukaryotic cells. The findings, published in Nature on February 20, address one of evolutionary biology's most persistent puzzles.\n\nResearchers at the University of Texas at Austin, led by marine scientist Brett Baker, assembled more than 13,000 new microbial genomes from roughly 15 terabytes of environmental DNA collected across multiple marine expeditions. From this dataset, the team recovered hundreds of previously unknown genomes belonging to Asgard archaea, a group widely regarded as the closest living relatives of the organism that gave rise to all complex life. The effort nearly doubled the known genomic diversity of the entire Asgard group and revealed previously unrecognized protein families, doubling the number of recognized enzymatic classes within these microbes.\n\nThe central finding challenges a longstanding assumption. Most known Asgard archaea inhabit oxygen-free deep-sea environments, which made it difficult to explain how they could have partnered with oxygen-dependent alphaproteobacteria — the symbiotic merger that scientists believe produced the first eukaryotic cell and its energy-producing mitochondria. Baker's team discovered that a subgroup called Heimdallarchaeia, the Asgards most closely related to eukaryotes, actually thrives in oxygen-rich shallow coastal sediments and open water columns. These organisms possess multiple metabolic pathways for oxygen use. Using the AI protein-structure prediction tool AlphaFold2, the researchers demonstrated that several Heimdallarchaeia proteins closely resemble those eukaryotic cells use today for oxygen-based energy metabolism.\n\nThe timeline reinforces the case. Following the Great Oxidation Event more than 1.7 billion years ago, when atmospheric oxygen levels surged, the earliest known eukaryotic microfossils appear in the geological record within a few hundred thousand years. \"Oxygen appeared in the environment, and Asgards adapted to that,\" Baker said. \"They found an energetic advantage to using oxygen, and then they evolved into eukaryotes.\"\n\nThe research, which grew from co-author Kathryn Appler's doctoral work beginning in 2019 at the UT Marine Science Institute, involved collaborators at Monash University in Australia, Wageningen University in the Netherlands, and several other institutions. Funding came in part from the Gordon and Betty Moore and Simons Foundations. By resolving the oxygen paradox at the heart of eukaryotic origins, the study offers the strongest evidence yet that breathable air was not merely a backdrop to the emergence of complex life — it was a catalyst.",

      "subheadline": "Ushikuvirus, isolated from a Japanese lake, exhibits unusual nuclear-disrupting behavior that bridges gaps in viral evolution",
      "body": "A newly identified giant virus isolated from a lake in Japan is providing fresh evidence for one of biology's most provocative hypotheses: that viruses may have given rise to the nucleus at the heart of all complex cells, effectively catalyzing the emergence of eukaryotic life on Earth.\n\nThe virus, named ushikuvirus after Lake Ushiku in Ibaraki Prefecture, was described in a study published in the Journal of Virology by a team led by Professor Masaharu Takemura of Tokyo University of Science alongside collaborators at Japan's National Institute of Natural Sciences. Ushikuvirus infects vermamoeba, a single-celled amoeba, and belongs to the broader group of giant DNA viruses — entities so large and genetically complex that they blur the traditional boundary between viruses and living cells. What makes this particular specimen significant is the way it replicates: unlike related viruses in the Mamonoviridae family, which commandeer the host cell's intact nucleus as a factory for producing new viral particles, ushikuvirus actively breaks down the nuclear membrane during replication.\n\nThat distinction matters because it positions ushikuvirus as a potential evolutionary link between two previously separate categories of giant viruses — those that replicate inside an intact nucleus, like medusavirus, and those that dismantle the nuclear membrane entirely, like pandoravirus. Takemura, who along with Macquarie University's Philip Bell independently proposed the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis in 2001, argues that such intermediate behaviors strengthen the case that a large DNA virus once established a stable symbiotic relationship inside an ancient archaeal cell, eventually transforming into the membrane-bound nucleus found in all eukaryotes today. That hypothesis gained significant traction after the first giant DNA viruses were discovered in 2003, revealing that some viral infections produce membrane-enclosed \"virus factories\" inside host cells that bear a striking resemblance to primitive nuclei.\n\nBeyond its evolutionary implications, ushikuvirus presents a suite of distinctive physical features. Its capsid surface is studded with spiked structures capped by unique formations, some trailing filament-like extensions never observed in related medusaviruses. Infected vermamoeba cells swell to unusual sizes, a cytopathic effect distinct from those caused by other known giant viruses. The research team — which included master's students Jiwan Bae and Narumi Hantori, along with Dr. Raymond Burton-Smith and Professor Kazuyoshi Murata — notes that these differences likely reflect long-term adaptation to different amoeba hosts.\n\nThe discovery also carries potential medical relevance. Certain amoeba species closely related to those infected by giant viruses can cause life-threatening conditions, including amoebic encephalitis. Understanding how giant viruses infiltrate and destroy amoebae could eventually inform new strategies for treating such infections. \"Giant viruses can be said to be a treasure trove whose world has yet to be fully understood,\" Takemura said. \"One of the future possibilities of this research is to provide humanity with a new view that connects the world of living organisms with the world of viruses.\"",

      "body": "A new theoretical framework shows that the temperature and velocity of a relativistic medium can be extracted purely from the random electromagnetic noise it naturally emits — eliminating the need for external probes, spectral line analysis, or absolute intensity calibration.\n\nPublished on the arXiv preprint server on February 18, physicist Ira Wolfson presents a method for reconstructing the inverse-temperature four-vector, the fundamental quantity describing thermal equilibrium in special relativity. Unlike classical thermodynamics, where temperature is a simple scalar, relativistic systems require a four-component object — denoted β^μ — that encodes both the rest-frame temperature and the medium's bulk drift velocity relative to an observer. Wolfson's key insight is that when a hot, moving plasma emits thermal radiation, a Lorentz boost transforms what would be isotropic noise in the plasma's rest frame into a distinctive pattern of correlated electric and magnetic field fluctuations. These correlations contain enough information to determine the drift velocity without any external reference.\n\nThe approach leverages the covariant fluctuation-dissipation theorem, a cornerstone result connecting thermal noise to the dissipative properties of a system. By measuring angle-resolved noise spectra from the electromagnetic emissions, the full four-vector β^μ can be assembled using only passive detection of stochastic fields. Critically, the method relies on a gain-independent observable — a ratio of fluctuation quantities that cancels out detector calibration factors — making it robust against the systematic uncertainties that typically plague precision plasma diagnostics.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations reported in the four-page paper demonstrate that the technique achieves percent-level accuracy at realistic signal-to-noise ratios. Feasibility estimates suggest that for laboratory plasmas, integration times on the order of sub-microsecond durations would be sufficient, placing the method well within reach of existing experimental capabilities. This speed could prove valuable in transient plasma experiments, including those in fusion energy research and high-energy-density physics, where conditions change rapidly.\n\nWolfson describes this as the first method capable of reconstructing the covariant thermal state of a relativistic medium from passive stochastic fields alone. If validated experimentally, the technique would establish vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations as a direct, operational probe of relativistic equilibrium — a conceptual advance that bridges plasma physics, statistical mechanics, and general relativity. The work has been cross-listed across all three of those arXiv categories, signaling its interdisciplinary significance.",

      "body": "A team of researchers has developed a novel generative AI framework that bakes the fundamental laws of electromagnetism directly into a diffusion model, enabling more accurate and physically consistent design of photonic metasurfaces — nanoscale structures that manipulate light in ways natural materials cannot.\n\nThe system, called MxDiffusion, was introduced in a preprint by Sujoy Mondal, Taehyuk Park, Sudipta Biswas, Alan X. Wang, and Wenshan Cai. Unlike conventional machine learning approaches to inverse photonic design, which rely entirely on training data to learn the relationship between a desired optical response and the structure that produces it, MxDiffusion incorporates Maxwell's equations — the foundational laws governing electromagnetic wave behavior — as an explicit constraint during model training. The result is a hybrid physics-and-data-driven system that generates photonic structures from target optical properties with significantly higher fidelity, particularly in challenging design scenarios.\n\nThe framework operates through a two-stage strategy. In the first stage, a diffusion model is trained using a loss function derived directly from Maxwell's equations, embedding physical principles into the generation process and producing a physically consistent intermediate representation. The second stage then translates that intermediate output into a final structural geometry. This division of labor allows the model to maintain physical plausibility while still leveraging the flexibility and generative power of modern diffusion architectures.\n\nThe researchers validated MxDiffusion on two representative test cases: gold nanostructures patterned on a silica substrate and a highly tunable bandpass filter based on phase-change material. In both scenarios, the physics-guided framework consistently outperformed a conventional data-driven diffusion model benchmark. The advantages were most pronounced for out-of-training-distribution design targets — cases where the desired optical response falls outside the range of examples the model was trained on — and for highly constrained resonance conditions, where small structural errors can produce large deviations in optical behavior.\n\nThe work addresses a persistent bottleneck in nanophotonics. Designing metasurfaces traditionally requires computationally expensive electromagnetic simulations, and purely data-driven inverse design methods often struggle with generalization and physical accuracy. By grounding the generative process in Maxwell's equations, MxDiffusion offers what the authors describe as a general physics-guided inverse design paradigm — one that could extend beyond photonics to other domains where governing physical laws can be mathematically encoded into machine learning pipelines. The preprint was posted to arXiv on February 18, 2026.",

      "body": "Paramount Skydance announced Friday that it faces no remaining statutory barrier in the United States to completing its proposed $77.9 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, after a critical antitrust review period expired without federal action to block the deal.\n\nThe company said it has fully complied with the U.S. Justice Department's second-request review process under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, a procedural step that allows regulators to scrutinize large mergers before they close. A mandatory 10-day waiting period following that compliance lapsed on Thursday, removing one of the most significant regulatory checkpoints standing between the two entertainment giants and a transformative combination.\n\nHowever, the expiration of the waiting period does not constitute regulatory approval. The Justice Department retains the authority to file suit to block the merger at any point, and has done so in past cases even after HSR waiting periods have passed. The distinction is an important one for investors and industry observers watching what would be one of the largest media deals in history — a transaction that would unite Paramount's film studio, CBS network, and streaming platform with Warner Bros. Discovery's sprawling portfolio of assets including HBO, CNN, and the Warner Bros. film and television operations.\n\nThe deal, which would reshape the competitive landscape of an entertainment industry already under intense pressure from streaming economics and cord-cutting, has drawn scrutiny from analysts questioning whether regulators in the current administration would permit such extensive consolidation. A combined entity would control an enormous share of scripted television production, film distribution, and streaming content, potentially raising concerns about market concentration and bargaining power over distributors.\n\nParamount Skydance — itself the product of Skydance Media's recent takeover of the legacy Paramount operation — framed the milestone as significant forward progress, stating it sees \"no statutory impediment\" to closing. Yet the path to completion likely involves additional regulatory reviews in international jurisdictions, and the Justice Department's silence should not be read as tacit endorsement. For now, the mega-merger remains alive, but far from assured.",

      "body": "A team of researchers has developed a more complete mathematical framework for predicting how electromagnetic beams heat biological skin tissue, closing a gap in previous models that failed to capture the significant effects of lateral heat conduction at realistic length scales.\n\nThe study, posted to the arXiv preprint server on February 18 by Ulises Jaime-Yepez, Hongyun Wang, Shannon E. Foley, and Hong Zhou, extends earlier work that derived only the leading-term asymptotic solution for temperature distribution during electromagnetic skin heating at arbitrary incident angles. The new analysis provides closed-form analytical expressions for both the first-order and second-order terms in an asymptotic expansion, enabling substantially more accurate temperature predictions — particularly in scenarios where the ratio of beam penetration depth to lateral beam size is moderate rather than vanishingly small.\n\nThe asymptotic approach exploits the fact that electromagnetic beams penetrate skin to a depth much smaller than their cross-sectional width, allowing the temperature field to be expanded in powers of this small depth-to-lateral scale ratio. A key finding is that while the incident angle of the beam affects all terms in the expansion, lateral heat conduction — the sideways spreading of thermal energy through tissue — appears only in terms of positive even powers. This means the leading-term solution, which was the state of the art from prior work, entirely misses the contribution of lateral conduction. At a depth-to-lateral ratio of 0.1, a value the authors characterize as moderate and physically relevant, the lateral conduction effect proves \"quite significant\" and cannot be neglected in any meaningful approximation.\n\nThe work spans classical physics and biological physics, reflecting its dual relevance to electromagnetic theory and biomedical applications. Electromagnetic skin heating arises in contexts ranging from medical therapies and dermatological treatments to safety assessments of radiation exposure. Accurate modeling of temperature distributions in tissue is critical for predicting thermal damage thresholds, optimizing therapeutic protocols, and understanding how beam geometry and orientation influence heating patterns beneath the skin surface.\n\nThe paper, which the authors describe as a preprint to be submitted for publication, represents a meaningful advance in the analytical toolkit available for these problems. By providing exact closed-form expressions rather than purely numerical solutions, the framework offers both computational efficiency and physical transparency — allowing researchers and engineers to directly see how each parameter governs the thermal response of irradiated tissue.",

      "subheadline": "Federal judge rejects automaker's motion, saying arguments were already 'considered and rejected' during trial",
      "body": "A federal judge has denied Tesla's attempt to reverse a $243 million jury verdict that found the automaker partially liable for a fatal 2019 crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver assistance system, dealing a significant blow to the company's legal defense of the technology.\n\nHon. Judge Beth Bloom ruled on February 20 that Tesla's arguments for overturning the verdict were essentially recycled from earlier stages of the litigation. \"The grounds for relief that Tesla relies upon are virtually the same as those Tesla put forth previously during the course of trial and in their briefings on summary judgment — arguments that were already considered and rejected,\" the judge wrote, adding that Tesla failed to present any new legal arguments or controlling law that would justify altering the jury's decision.\n\nThe case stems from a 2019 crash in Florida that killed Naibel Benavides and critically injured Dillon Angulo. Last August, a jury awarded $243 million in damages, assigning two-thirds of the blame to the driver and one-third to Tesla. In a notable detail, the jury levied punitive damages exclusively against Tesla — a signal that jurors found the company's conduct warranted punishment beyond simple compensation. Tesla's legal team had argued that responsibility for the crash rested squarely with the driver.\n\nThe ruling carries broad implications for Tesla as it faces mounting legal scrutiny over its driver assistance technology. Autopilot, which handles certain steering, acceleration, and braking functions, has been at the center of numerous lawsuits and federal investigations. Critics have long argued that Tesla's marketing and naming of the system encourages drivers to over-rely on technology that still requires active human supervision. The company maintains that Autopilot is designed to assist — not replace — an attentive driver.\n\nThe decision arrives at a sensitive moment for Tesla, which continues to push aggressively into autonomous driving with its Full Self-Driving software. With the $243 million verdict now upheld, the case could embolden plaintiffs in other pending Autopilot-related lawsuits and increase pressure on regulators to impose stricter oversight on advanced driver assistance systems across the industry.",

Blue Owl, which has built itself into one of the sector's most prominent players, turned to a mix of external and internal buyers to liquidate the loan book, a maneuver that highlights both the depth of institutional demand for private debt and the potential conflicts that arise when firms sell assets to entities they control.\n\nThe sale to Blue Owl's own insurance asset manager is likely to draw particular scrutiny. Asset managers that also operate or advise insurance affiliates have faced mounting regulatory attention over concerns that captive insurers can serve as convenient warehouses for assets that might otherwise be difficult to move.

Pension systems across North America have been shifting portfolios toward private markets in search of higher yields and diversification away from publicly traded fixed income, a trend that has accelerated as private credit has expanded to fill lending gaps left by traditional banks.\n\nBlue Owl Capital, publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has amassed significant scale in direct lending and other alternative credit strategies. The firm's ability to orchestrate a $1.4 billion secondary sale to meet investor redemptions suggests both robust demand for its loan assets and the operational complexity of managing liquidity in funds that invest in inherently illiquid instruments.

      "body": "A recent Supreme Court ruling on tariffs has injected fresh uncertainty into markets already grappling with the financial toll of trade restrictions on corporate America, according to a senior political risk adviser at Teneo.\n\nKevin Kajiwara, co-president of political risk advisory at the consulting firm, said in a Bloomberg Television appearance on Thursday that while tariffs have already left visible marks on corporate income statements and balance sheets, the high court's decision introduces an additional dimension of unpredictability for businesses and investors. Speaking on Bloomberg's \"The Close\" with Romaine Bostick and Katie Greifeld, Kajiwara outlined how the legal landscape surrounding trade policy is now compounding the economic pressures companies have been absorbing for months.\n\nThe comments underscore a growing concern among risk consultants and market strategists that U.S. trade policy has become a multi-front challenge for corporations. Beyond the direct cost increases from tariffs — which have forced companies to raise prices, absorb margin compression, or restructure supply chains — firms must now contend with evolving judicial interpretations of executive trade authority. The Supreme Court's involvement signals that the constitutional boundaries of tariff powers remain a live and contested legal question, one with potentially far-reaching consequences for how aggressively the executive branch can deploy trade barriers.\n\nKajiwara also flagged geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran as a concurrent risk factor for markets. The convergence of trade uncertainty with Middle Eastern security concerns creates a complex backdrop for corporate planning and investor positioning heading into the spring. Teneo, which advises major multinational companies on navigating political and regulatory risks, has seen demand for its services rise as firms struggle to scenario-plan amid overlapping policy and geopolitical disruptions.\n\nFor market participants, the message is sobering: tariff risk is no longer confined to spreadsheet calculations of duty rates and sourcing costs. It now encompasses constitutional law, judicial unpredictability, and the potential for abrupt shifts in the legal framework governing international trade — all layered atop a geopolitical environment that shows few signs of stabilizing.",

By assembling a group of institutional buyers willing to absorb the sizable loan book, the alternative asset manager was able to generate the liquidity needed to meet its payout obligations. The involvement of Blue Owl's own insurance arm in the transaction, however, is likely to draw scrutiny from market observers who monitor potential conflicts of interest when firms act on both sides of a deal.\n\nThe transaction underscores a growing dynamic in private credit markets, where managers increasingly rely on large institutional buyers — particularly pension funds and insurance companies hungry for yield — to provide secondary liquidity for portfolios that were originally designed to be held to maturity. As private credit has ballooned into a multi-trillion-dollar asset class, the infrastructure for trading and recycling these illiquid positions has become a critical piece of the market's plumbing.\n\nBlue Owl, which manages more than $200 billion in assets across private credit, GP stakes, and real estate strategies, has built one of the largest direct lending platforms in the industry. The New York-based firm has expanded aggressively into insurance asset management, a channel that has become a major source of permanent capital for alternative managers. That Blue Owl turned partly to its own insurance unit to absorb loans from a separate fund highlights how vertically integrated many of these platforms have become.\n\nFor the pension funds involved, the acquisition represents an opportunity to gain exposure to seasoned private credit assets at potentially attractive terms, bypassing the typical blind-pool commitment structure. The identities of the three pension buyers were not disclosed. The deal also reflects the broader trend of Canadian and American public pension systems allocating increasing shares of their portfolios to private debt as they seek returns above what public fixed-income markets currently offer.",

Blue Owl Capital, a major player in alternative asset management, operates several BDCs that provide financing to middle-market companies — vehicles that have surged in popularity as private credit has ballooned into one of the fastest-growing corners of finance.\n\nThe tender offers come after what Bloomberg described as a challenging week for Blue Owl, though the specific difficulties were not detailed. The broader context, however, is unmistakable: investors and regulators alike have grown increasingly wary of the rapid expansion of private credit, which has swelled to roughly $1.8 trillion in assets. Critics warn that the sector's explosive growth, fueled by years of institutional capital flooding into alternatives, may be masking credit quality issues that could surface as economic conditions shift.\n\nBDCs, which are publicly traded vehicles that lend to private companies, often trade at discounts to their net asset value — a gap that activist investors like Weinstein have historically targeted. By launching tender offers, Saba and Cox are effectively betting they can acquire shares below intrinsic value, pressuring Blue Owl's management in the process. Weinstein's Saba Capital has been involved in numerous campaigns against closed-end funds and similar structures, frequently pushing for measures to narrow trading discounts.\n\nThe campaign adds another front to the growing tension between alternative asset managers and activist investors who argue that certain fund structures inadequately serve shareholders. For Blue Owl, which has built a significant franchise in private credit and GP stakes investing, the tender offers could force a public defense of its BDC valuations and governance at a moment when the broader market is already scrutinizing the sector's fundamentals.",

      "body": "NASA has confirmed a target launch date of March 6 for Artemis II, the mission that will send four astronauts around the Moon and back — marking humanity's deepest venture into space and the first crewed lunar voyage since the Apollo era ended in 1972.\n\nThe agency locked in the date after completing a successful \"wet dress rehearsal\" at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Thursday, a critical test in which the 98-meter-tall Space Launch System (SLS) rocket was fully loaded with propellant and taken through its countdown sequence. The milestone came on the team's second attempt; an earlier rehearsal in early February was cut short by a hydrogen fuel leak at the launch pad. NASA's Lori Glaze told a Friday press conference that seal and filter issues had been resolved, and that the rocket was fueled within the planned timeline. The four-person crew — Americans Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, joined by Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen — entered quarantine on Friday.\n\nThe 10-day mission profile calls for the crew to spend their first day orbiting Earth inside the Orion capsule, a cabin roughly the size of a minibus mounted atop the SLS. If systems check out, they will fire toward the Moon on a four-day transit, swinging around its far side at an altitude of 6,500 to 9,500 kilometers above the lunar surface. The astronauts will have several hours to study and photograph the Moon before beginning a four-day return trip, culminating in a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. The SLS has flown only once before, carrying an uncrewed Orion capsule on the Artemis I test flight in November 2022.\n\nA successful Artemis II would set the stage for Artemis III, the mission intended to put boots on the lunar surface for the first time in more than half a century. NASA has targeted 2028 for that landing, though the timeline remains ambitious. SpaceX holds the contract to build the Artemis III lunar lander using a variant of its Starship vehicle, but persistent delays have prompted NASA to request an accelerated development plan. The agency has also asked Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos's space company, to propose a faster path to the Moon as a potential alternative.\n\nThe urgency is partly geopolitical. China has announced plans for a crewed lunar landing by 2030 and has demonstrated steady progress toward that goal. Both the United States and China are eyeing the Moon's south pole as the prime location for future bases, creating a new era of space competition that lends strategic weight to every launch window NASA can meet.",

The Trump administration has pursued an aggressive sanctions posture toward Havana, building on measures tightened during the president's first term and further expanded since his return to office. Russia, meanwhile, remains subject to sweeping U.S. financial and trade penalties stemming from its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCuba has been mired in a severe energy crisis that has left millions of residents enduring rolling blackouts, fuel shortages, and collapsing infrastructure. The island's antiquated power grid, heavily dependent on imported petroleum, has struggled to meet even basic demand. Russia has historically been a key energy supplier to Cuba, stepping into a role once filled by Venezuela, whose own economic troubles have curtailed its ability to deliver subsidized oil to allied nations.\n\nThe shipment poses a delicate enforcement question for Washington. Intercepting or deterring the tanker would signal robust sanctions enforcement but could escalate tensions with Moscow at a moment when U.S.-Russia relations are already under intense scrutiny. Allowing the delivery to proceed, however, risks undermining the credibility of the broader sanctions framework and inviting further attempts to circumvent American restrictions. The scenario also highlights the persistent challenge of policing global maritime trade routes, where sanctions evasion tactics — including ship-to-ship transfers, flag changes, and opaque ownership structures — have become increasingly sophisticated.\n\nThe situation underscores the broader geopolitical chess match playing out in the Western Hemisphere, where Russia has maintained strategic relationships with Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua even as the United States has sought to isolate those governments economically and diplomatically. How the Trump administration responds to this particular shipment could set a precedent for future enforcement actions and signal its priorities in balancing Cuba policy against its wider approach to Russia.",

      "body": "Emerging-market stocks, currencies, and bonds rallied sharply after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs, removing one of the most significant headwinds that had weighed on developing economies for months.\n\nThe landmark ruling sent a wave of relief through global markets, with emerging-market currencies erasing their weekly losses in a single session. BlackRock's flagship emerging-market exchange-traded fund surged to a record high as investors rapidly repriced the outlook for trade-dependent economies that had been most vulnerable to the tariff regime. The decision effectively invalidated the broad-based import duties that Trump had imposed, which had disrupted supply chains and dampened growth prospects across Asia, Latin America, and other developing regions.\n\nThe court's intervention marks a pivotal turning point for emerging markets, which had been caught in the crossfire of escalating trade tensions. Nations that rely heavily on exports to the United States — including major manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia and commodity producers in Latin America — stand to benefit most directly from the removal of tariff barriers. The ruling also alleviates pressure on central banks in developing countries that had been forced to defend their currencies against dollar strength driven in part by trade uncertainty.\n\nThe rally in the BlackRock ETF to all-time highs signals that institutional investors are moving quickly to rebuild positions in emerging-market assets. Portfolio flows into developing economies had slowed significantly during the tariff regime, as fund managers weighed the risks of holding assets in countries facing potential export disruptions. With that overhang now lifted by the Supreme Court, strategists expect a period of sustained inflows as valuations in many emerging markets remain attractive relative to developed-market peers.\n\nWhile the immediate market reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, analysts caution that the broader policy landscape remains uncertain. The Trump administration could pursue alternative trade measures that fall within constitutional boundaries, and geopolitical tensions — including building concerns over Iran — continue to pose risks to emerging-market stability. Still, for now, the court's decision has delivered the clearest positive catalyst for developing economies in months, resetting expectations for growth, trade, and capital flows across the emerging world.",

      "subheadline": "New open-source benchmark reveals domain-specific AI detected vulnerabilities worth $96.8M versus just $7.5M for a standard GPT-5.1 agent",
      "body": "A specialized artificial intelligence security system identified exploitable vulnerabilities in 92 percent of real-world decentralized finance smart contracts that had already been hacked, dramatically outperforming a general-purpose AI coding agent that caught only 34 percent, according to new research published Thursday by AI security firm Cecuro.\n\nThe study tested both systems against a benchmark of 90 smart contracts exploited between October 2024 and early 2026, collectively representing $228 million in verified losses. The purpose-built agent flagged flaws tied to $96.8 million in exploit value, while a baseline agent built on OpenAI's GPT-5.1 managed to cover just $7.5 million. Critically, both systems ran on the same underlying frontier model — the performance gap stemmed entirely from domain-specific methodology, structured audit phases, and DeFi-focused security heuristics layered on top by Cecuro's team. Several of the exploited contracts in the dataset had previously passed professional security audits before being drained.\n\nThe findings land at a particularly fraught moment for crypto security. Separate research from Anthropic and OpenAI has demonstrated that AI agents can now execute end-to-end exploits on most known vulnerable smart contracts at an average cost of roughly $1.22 per attempt, with offensive exploit capability reportedly doubling every 1.3 months. North Korean hacking operations have already begun integrating AI tools to automate and scale their attacks, widening what researchers describe as a growing asymmetry between offensive and defensive AI capabilities in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nCecuro has open-sourced its benchmark dataset, evaluation framework, and baseline agent on GitHub, but the firm declined to release its full specialized security agent, citing concerns that the tooling could be repurposed by attackers. The company argues that many DeFi teams continue to rely on general-purpose AI tools or periodic one-off audits — an approach the benchmark data suggests is inadequate for catching the high-value, complex vulnerabilities that sophisticated attackers target.\n\nThe research underscores a broader tension in the race between AI-powered offense and defense in decentralized finance. As the cost and technical barrier to launching AI-driven exploits continues to plummet, the results suggest that generic AI models alone are insufficient for meaningful smart contract security — and that the application layer built around a model may matter far more than the model itself.",

      "body": "Canadian equities surged on Thursday after the United States Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs, removing one of the most significant sources of uncertainty that had weighed on cross-border commerce for months.\n\nCanada's benchmark stock index posted broad-based gains as investors recalibrated their outlook for the country's export-heavy economy. The ruling effectively dismantles a tariff regime that had disrupted supply chains and dampened business confidence across North America, particularly in Canada, where roughly three-quarters of exports are destined for the U.S. market. Sectors with heavy American exposure — including energy, manufacturing, and materials — were among the biggest beneficiaries of the post-ruling rally.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision marks a pivotal moment in the legal battle over Trump's trade agenda, which had drawn challenges from multiple trading partners and domestic industry groups arguing the tariffs exceeded presidential authority. While the full scope of the ruling and its implications for existing trade agreements remain subject to legal interpretation, markets moved swiftly to price in a more favorable environment for Canadian exporters. The Canadian dollar also strengthened against its U.S. counterpart in the wake of the news.\n\nThe tariffs had been a persistent drag on Canadian markets since their implementation, prompting retaliatory measures from Ottawa and fueling fears of a broader economic slowdown. Canadian business leaders and policymakers had repeatedly warned that prolonged trade barriers risked undermining the deeply integrated North American economy, where goods and components routinely cross the border multiple times during production.\n\nAnalysts cautioned that volatility could persist as the legal and political fallout from the ruling unfolds. The Trump administration could pursue alternative trade measures or seek legislative avenues to reimpose duties, leaving some uncertainty intact. Still, for now, the court's decision has provided a significant tailwind for Canadian equities and a measure of relief to businesses on both sides of the border that had been navigating an unpredictable trade landscape.",

      "subheadline": "Chief Justice Roberts writes majority opinion finding president exceeded his authority; markets rally on the decision",
      "body": "The United States Supreme Court on Thursday declared President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs unconstitutional, ruling 6-3 that the president overstepped his executive authority in imposing the trade levies. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion in what stands as one of the most consequential checks on presidential trade power in decades.\n\nThe decision immediately reverberated through financial markets. U.S. equities and Treasury yields jumped on the news, while the dollar weakened — a signal that investors view the removal of tariffs as a net positive for the domestic economy and a potential easing of inflationary pressures that had built up since the duties were first imposed. The tariffs, which targeted imports from countries around the world, had been a cornerstone of Trump's economic agenda and a persistent source of friction with trading partners.\n\nPresident Trump responded sharply, calling the ruling a \"disgrace\" — language that underscores the political stakes of the decision and sets the stage for a potential confrontation between the executive branch and the judiciary over the limits of trade authority. The ruling effectively curtails the president's ability to unilaterally impose broad-based tariffs without explicit congressional authorization, a question that legal scholars and trade policy experts have debated since the tariffs were first enacted.\n\nThe 6-3 split suggests the court's decision crossed ideological lines, with Roberts — a George W. Bush appointee — leading a coalition that included justices from both conservative and liberal wings of the bench. The ruling carries significant implications not only for current trade policy but for the broader balance of power between Congress and the White House on economic matters. Constitutional experts say the opinion could reshape how future administrations approach tariff authority under statutes like the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\n\nFor businesses and consumers, the practical effect may be substantial. The global tariffs had raised costs across a wide range of imported goods, contributing to elevated prices and supply chain adjustments. Their removal could provide relief to industries from manufacturing to retail, though the timeline for unwinding the tariffs and any potential legislative response from Congress remains unclear. The White House has not yet indicated whether it will seek alternative legal avenues to reimpose the duties.",

      "subheadline": "A sprawling web of import levies across sectors and countries is altering supply chains and raising prices for businesses and consumers",
      "body": "President Donald Trump's expansive tariff agenda has grown into one of the most aggressive trade policy campaigns in modern American history, imposing levies across a broad swath of industries and trading partners that are rippling through the global economy.\n\nThe administration has enacted tariffs targeting steel, aluminum, automobiles, and a wide range of Chinese goods, among other categories, creating a complex and shifting landscape that businesses must navigate in real time. The cumulative effect has pushed the effective U.S. tariff rate to levels not seen in decades, according to trade economists, with some estimates suggesting it now exceeds rates that prevailed before the mid-20th century liberalization of global commerce. China has faced some of the steepest levies, with tariffs on certain goods reaching well above 100 percent after successive rounds of escalation.\n\nThe economic consequences are increasingly tangible. Importers face higher costs that many are passing along to consumers, contributing to upward pressure on prices for everything from electronics to household goods. Manufacturers that depend on imported components have been forced to reconfigure supply chains, in some cases shifting sourcing to countries not subject to the highest tariffs — a phenomenon economists call trade diversion. Retaliatory measures from trading partners, particularly China, Canada, and the European Union, have meanwhile squeezed American exporters, especially in agriculture.\n\nThe administration has argued the tariffs serve multiple strategic objectives: reducing the U.S. trade deficit, reviving domestic manufacturing, and providing leverage in bilateral negotiations. Some sectors, notably steel production, have seen modest employment gains. But broader economic assessments have been more cautious. Multiple analyses suggest the tariffs function as a tax on American consumers and businesses, with the costs outweighing the targeted benefits. The Federal Reserve and private forecasters have flagged tariff-related uncertainty as a drag on business investment.\n\nAs the tariff regime continues to evolve — with pauses, exemptions, and new levies announced at irregular intervals — the lack of predictability has become a challenge in its own right. Companies report difficulty planning capital expenditures when the rules of international commerce can shift with a single presidential announcement. The ultimate economic toll will depend on whether the tariffs prove to be temporary negotiating tools or permanent features of U.S. trade policy, a question that remains unresolved as the administration presses forward on multiple fronts simultaneously.",

      "subheadline": "President invokes Section 122 authority to reimpose sweeping trade barriers, declares all national security tariffs remain in effect",
      "body": "President Donald Trump moved swiftly on Friday to reimpose broad trade barriers on imports worldwide, announcing a 10% global tariff just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down his administration's earlier tariff regime as unconstitutional.\n\nSpeaking at a White House press conference, Trump said the new levy — which would be layered on top of existing duties — would be authorized under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, a rarely invoked provision that grants the president temporary authority to impose tariffs of up to 15% for 150 days to address large and serious balance-of-payments deficits. The president simultaneously declared that all national security tariffs imposed under Section 232, as well as existing Section 301 tariffs targeting specific countries and industries, remain in full force and effect.\n\nThe announcement represents a dramatic legal pivot by the administration, which had relied on broader executive authority to justify its earlier global tariff program before the Supreme Court invalidated that approach. By shifting to Section 122, Trump is effectively daring opponents to mount a fresh legal challenge while maintaining economic pressure on trading partners. Legal experts have noted, however, that Section 122 imposes significant constraints — including a cap on tariff rates and a built-in expiration — that could limit the administration's ability to sustain the policy long-term without congressional action.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling earlier Friday marked one of the most significant checks on presidential trade authority in decades, finding that the administration had exceeded its statutory power in levying sweeping tariffs without explicit congressional authorization. Markets had initially rallied on the decision, but gains were quickly pared as Trump signaled his intent to find alternative legal pathways to maintain the tariffs. The rapid response underscores the administration's determination to preserve its aggressive trade posture as a cornerstone of economic policy.\n\nThe reimposition of a 10% blanket tariff is likely to reignite tensions with major trading partners, including the European Union, China, and Japan, all of which had signaled relief at the court's ruling. Business groups and importers, who had lobbied aggressively against the earlier tariff regime, now face renewed uncertainty over supply chains and input costs. With the Section 122 clock ticking from the moment of imposition, attention will turn quickly to whether Congress moves to codify or block the tariffs — and whether a second round of legal challenges can reach the courts before the duties take full economic effect.",

      "body": "Dubai's government real estate authority has launched a secondary trading market for blockchain-based property tokens, advancing one of the most ambitious tokenization experiments in the world. The Dubai Land Department (DLD) and infrastructure partner Ctrl Alt announced on Friday that roughly 7.8 million tokens representing fractional ownership in ten Dubai properties — valued at over $5 million — are now eligible for resale on a controlled trading platform.\n\nThe tokens, built on Ripple's XRP Ledger and secured through Ripple Custody, are directly backed by title deeds and synced with Dubai's official land registry. A compliance layer using so-called Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVAs) governs who can trade and under what conditions, ensuring that every transaction is reflected in the emirate's property records. The setup represents a deliberate effort to bridge decentralized blockchain infrastructure with traditional real estate law.\n\nThe secondary market launch constitutes the second phase of a pilot that began when the DLD partnered with Ctrl Alt and Prypco to tokenize property deeds on the XRP Ledger. The broader ambition is sweeping: Dubai aims to tokenize 7% of its real estate market — approximately $16 billion worth — by 2033. If successful, the initiative could position the city-state as the global leader in blockchain-based property transactions, where ownership transfers that currently take days or weeks could settle in minutes.\n\nThe project arrives at a moment of growing momentum for real-world asset tokenization globally. A Deloitte report published last year projected that $4 trillion in real estate will be tokenized by 2035, implying annual growth of roughly 27%. Yet significant obstacles remain. An EY analysis has noted that uneven regulation across jurisdictions continues to limit adoption, while thin secondary market liquidity — the very problem Dubai's pilot seeks to address — constrains investor interest. In the United States, real estate billionaire Barry Sternlicht has publicly expressed interest in tokenization but cited regulatory barriers as a major impediment.\n\nDubai's controlled trading environment is designed to test market infrastructure, investor protections, and legal alignment before any broader rollout. While $5 million in tradable property tokens remains a tiny fraction of the emirate's roughly $229 billion real estate market, the pilot's significance lies in what it is proving: that government registries and blockchain settlement can operate in tandem. Whether that model scales to $16 billion will depend on liquidity depth, regulatory durability, and whether investors trust tokens as much as traditional title deeds.",

      "body": "Crude oil prices remained elevated near six-month highs on Thursday after President Donald Trump disclosed he is considering a limited military strike against Iran, injecting fresh geopolitical risk into global energy markets already grappling with tight supply dynamics.\n\nTrump's remarks, in which he warned Tehran it had no more than 15 days to reach an agreement over its nuclear program, came as U.S. military forces were reported gathering in the Middle East. The combination of an explicit ultimatum and visible force posturing sent a clear signal that Washington is prepared to escalate if diplomatic efforts stall. Iran, an OPEC member that produces roughly 3.2 million barrels per day, sits at a critical chokepoint for global oil flows — any disruption to its output or to shipping through the Strait of Hormuz could ripple through markets worldwide.\n\nThe threat alone has been sufficient to buoy prices. Oil traders have been pricing in a growing geopolitical risk premium, reflecting the possibility that even a limited strike could trigger retaliatory actions that disrupt regional production or tanker traffic. The Strait of Hormuz, through which approximately 20% of the world's petroleum passes daily, remains the most watched bottleneck in global energy logistics. Market participants are now closely monitoring diplomatic channels for any indication of whether Tehran will engage in negotiations or dig in ahead of the deadline.\n\nThe standoff adds another layer of complexity to an oil market already shaped by OPEC+ production management, sanctions enforcement, and shifting demand forecasts. Analysts note that sustained elevated prices could compound inflationary pressures in the United States and Europe at a time when central banks are navigating delicate monetary policy paths. For consumers, a prolonged crisis could translate into higher gasoline and heating costs heading into the spring.\n\nWith the 15-day window now ticking, energy markets are likely to remain volatile as traders weigh the probability of a diplomatic resolution against the risk of military action. The coming days will test whether Trump's ultimatum represents a genuine redline or a negotiating tactic designed to force Tehran back to the table.",

      "body": "A man in his sixties from Stockport, Greater Manchester, has been charged with 48 criminal counts for allegedly drugging his wife into unconsciousness and facilitating her sexual assault by multiple men over a period stretching back to the early 2000s.\n\nThe husband, who cannot be named for legal reasons, faces charges including conspiracy to rape, sexual assault by penetration, and conspiracy to administer a substance with intent to commit a sexual offence. Twelve other men, ranging in age from 28 to 73, are co-defendants in the case. All 13 appeared at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court, where seven — including the husband — entered not guilty pleas to all charges. Five defendants were not asked to enter pleas at this stage. One man pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit rape, conspiracy to administer a substance with intent, conspiracy to commit sexual assault by penetration, and one count of committing sexual assault by penetration.\n\nMembers of the woman's family were present in the public gallery during the hearing. The allegations describe a prolonged pattern of abuse in which the victim was rendered unconscious before being subjected to sexual violence by her husband and men he allegedly recruited. The case bears striking similarities to the high-profile French trial of Dominique Pelicot, who was convicted in December 2024 of drugging his wife Gisèle and inviting dozens of strangers to rape her over nearly a decade.\n\nA further hearing is scheduled for March, with a full trial set to begin on September 1. The proceedings are expected to last approximately 12 weeks, reflecting the breadth and complexity of the charges. Greater Manchester Police are leading the investigation.\n\nThe case underscores ongoing concerns about drug-facilitated sexual violence within intimate relationships — crimes that experts say remain significantly underreported due to victims being unaware of the abuse while it occurs. Legal observers note that the scale of the alleged conspiracy, involving more than a dozen defendants over two decades, makes it one of the most significant cases of its kind to come before UK courts.",

      "body": "Shares of trade-sensitive companies across the retail, industrial, and automotive sectors jumped sharply on Friday after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs, removing a major overhang that had weighed on corporate earnings outlooks and supply chain planning for months.\n\nThe ruling, which invalidated the broad tariff regime Trump had imposed on imports from countries around the world, sent an immediate jolt through equity markets. Retailers — many of which rely heavily on imported consumer goods — were among the biggest beneficiaries, alongside industrial manufacturers and automakers whose complex global supply chains had been disrupted and made more costly by the levies. The decision effectively unwound one of the most consequential trade policy experiments in modern American history, restoring a degree of certainty to businesses that had struggled to price in the unpredictable tariff landscape.\n\nThe Supreme Court's intervention marks a dramatic check on executive trade authority and is likely to reshape the legal and political boundaries of presidential power over commerce. While the specifics of the court's reasoning were not immediately detailed, the market's reaction suggested investors had been pricing in at least some probability that the tariffs would remain in place. The swift rally indicated significant pent-up demand for exposure to trade-dependent sectors that had been under pressure.\n\nFor retailers, the ruling could translate into lower input costs and improved margins in coming quarters, particularly for companies that source heavily from Asia. Automakers, which had faced the dual burden of higher component costs and retaliatory measures from trading partners, stand to benefit from both reduced expenses and potentially reopened export markets. Industrial firms with sprawling international operations may see relief on both the cost and revenue sides of their ledgers.\n\nThe broader implications for U.S. trade policy remain to be seen. The decision could constrain future administrations' ability to impose unilateral tariffs without congressional approval, fundamentally altering the balance of power over trade. Market participants will be closely watching for any legislative response from Capitol Hill, as well as the administration's next moves in the wake of what amounts to a historic judicial rebuke of its economic agenda.",
